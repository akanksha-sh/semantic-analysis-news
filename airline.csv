While fully vaccinated tourists headed for the Mediterranean were cheered by the removal of quarantine requirements on their return, people bound for France hit out at a decision late Friday that means they’ll still need to self-isolate. Madeline Russell, a London-based dentist flying to the southern French city of Toulouse to visit her mother, said she was skeptical that the spread of the beta variant of Covid-19 was the sole motivation for reinstating the quarantine, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government has maintained. “There are obviously underlying political reasons why they singled out France,” Russell said before boarding a British Airways flight with her husband and baby. “What’s most frustrating is that they chop and change. They announce something then rapidly change tune so quickly.” The U.K. created a new “amber plus” category in its traffic-light border system that makes it harder to travel to France, the only country with that designation. The decision prompted outrage from travel groups and sent shares of airline companies plummeting on Monday. French officials said the move wasn’t based on science. Heathrow, Europe’s busiest hub before the coronavirus hit, said passenger numbers remained steady after picking up last week, though without the six-hour lines for incoming travelers seen then. Immigration Services Union spokeswoman Lucy Moreton reported no major disruption at the U.K. border, with a peak wait of two hours, about standard for the airport amid checks on the testing and vaccination status of arrivals. Passengers queue at the Easyjet Plc check-in area at London Luton Airport, on July 19. The Bloomberg EMEA Airlines Index slid 5.7%, the most since in 10 months, to the lowest point since January. The carnage hit carriers focused on the U.K. leisure trade, including EasyJet Plc, its larger Irish rival Ryanair Holdings Plc, and package holiday giant TUI AG. British Airways owner IAG SA fell 5.2%, while rival Air France-KLM lost 2.9%, as the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the U.S. dimmed hopes for a renewal of transatlantic links. Closely held Heathrow on Monday asked holders of four Heathrow Finance-issued bonds to amend covenants amid the ongoing passenger-traffic slump. The airport had first secured looser terms on the debt a year earlier, before the  coronavirus crisis proved its staying power. At London Luton airport, the home base of EasyJet, passenger numbers are still at 25% or less of pre-pandemic levels, despite a marginal increase over the past week. The French and British governments have sparred on a number of fronts since the U.K.’s exit from the European Union took effect at the start of the year, including fishing rights and Northern Ireland. There has been press speculation that restrictions on Britons traveling into the EU may have factored into the creation of the amber plus category. The new rule for France drew an angry response from tourism bodies and airlines over the weekend, with International Air Transport Association Director General Willie Walsh saying Britain had “no coherent policy on international travel.” “The measure that was taken by the U.K. isn’t completely grounded in science,” France’s European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune said in an RMC radio interview. France is using “scientific and health criteria” that allows vaccinated people from Britain to enter without quarantine, while those who aren’t must self-isolate, he said. While some Heathrow passengers expressed frustration at the rapidly changing travel rules, others were waiting to board in the knowledge that they’d no longer face time cooped up at home on their return from medium-risk destinations on the Britain’s so-called amber list. Peter Phillips, an administrator at University College London, booked a holiday with his wife and daughters on the Greek island of Rhodes last December and said the removal of quarantines for fully vaccinated travelers came as a relief after months of concern about whether they’d get to fly, and on what terms. “The lead-up has been stressful with cases going up,” he said. “You wonder if you’re doing the right thing. We want to be as safe as possible as we are both double vaccinated. It feels like it is worth the risk.” The family booked a separate break on England’s bracing North Sea coast in case their journey to Greece became impossible. In the arrivals hall of Heathrow’s Terminal 5, some passengers expressed surprise at how quickly they were processed. Ed Horrocks, flying in from Chicago for a wedding in the U.K., used a regular line rather than an electronic gate and said there were fewer people than he’d expected. But at Terminal 2, passengers said the wait still seemed excessive. Annie Wright, who flew in from Newark, New Jersey, on a leisure visit, said she stood in a “massive line” for two hours, with the holdup compounded by problems with her mask at an e-gate. The U.K. also switched its position on another major holiday market, Spain’s Balearic Islands, last week, moving them to amber status from green amid concern about a surge in the delta variant of Covid-19 in resorts popular with younger people who may not have had the jab. The changes suggest that even people flying out now may not be guaranteed a quarantine-free return, with the moves stoking concerns about the status of other amber-list locations. Dentist Russell said that the u-turn on France will mean other colleagues have to cover for her, and that the family has spent hundreds of pounds on coronavirus tests that are now applicable to their situation. “There are financial implications, work implications,” she said. “It’s a bitter pill to swallow.”"

The U.S. will send India raw materials and step up financing aid for vaccine production, joining European countries in helping stem the world’s biggest surge in cases. President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser said the U.S. will also consider offering India unused doses of AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine. The U.S. will send India raw materials for vaccines and step up financing aid for Covid-19 shot production, joining European countries in helping stem the world’s biggest surge in cases. Material needed to produce Covishield, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made in India, has been sourced and “will immediately be made available for India,” Emily Horne, a spokesperson for U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, said in a statement. France plans to supply India with “significant support in terms of oxygen” in the coming days, French President Emmanuel Macron’s office told Agence France-Presse on Sunday. Ventilators will also be sent, AFP reported. Human movement through land ports between Bangladesh and India will remain suspended for two weeks, the Bangladesh foreign ministry said in a statement. Bangladeshi citizens currently traveling in India will be allowed to return home through three designated land ports. President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser said the U.S. will consider sending India unused, unapproved doses of AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine to help stem a record-breaking surge in Covid-19 cases there. “I think that’s going to be something that is up for active consideration,” Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” while cautioning that he didn’t “want to be speaking for policy right now.” The U.S. stockpile of AstraZeneca shots reached more than 20 million doses earlier this month and has grown since then, prompting persistent calls by doctors to donate the shots to other countries that are way behind the U.S. in their vaccination efforts. Governor Mike DeWine said demand for the vaccine has dropped sharply in Ohio, and he’s reaching out to businesses and schools to increase the number of people inoculated. “Well, I’m worried,” the Republican governor said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “We’ve seen our vaccination rate go down about half of what it was three weeks ago, so that’s a concern.” He said 40% of the population has at least one dose. “We just need to continue to move forward,” he said. Italy banned people who have been in India in the last 14 days from entering the country to counter the spread of the virus variant helpig fuel the outbreak in India, Health Minister Roberto Speranza said on Sunday. Italian residents are allowed to come back from India after a test on departure and on arrival home, and they will be quarantined. Mauritius, an Indian Ocean tourism-reliant economy, is set to further ease restrictions starting May 1, Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth said. No new cases were detected on Sunday. “The situation has vastly and rapidly improved,” Jugnauth said in a statement. Under the new rules, inhabitants will no longer require a permit to move around. The obligation to shop based on alphabetical order is waived. Gatherings of up to 10 people will be allowed. The U.K. is sending more than 600 pieces of medical kit to India to support the country in its fight against Covid-19, the government announced Sunday. Nine airline container loads of supplies, including 495 oxygen concentrators, 120 non-invasive ventilators and 20 manual ventilators, will be sent to the country this week. The first shipment is leaving the U.K. on Monday, arriving in New Delhi in the early hours of Tuesday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in an emailed statement: “We stand side by side with India as a friend and partner during what is a deeply concerning time in the fight against Covid-19.” A partisan divide remains over vaccines in the U.S., according to an NBC News poll. The survey of 1,000 adults showed that 82% of Democrats had been vaccinated or plan to as soon as possible, against 45% of Republicans. Overall, 57% said they’d had a vaccine and another 8% plan to as soon as they can. Some 24% of Republicans said they won’t get vaccinated, against just 4% of Democrats. Another 19% of GOP respondents said they’re waiting to see if there are problems with the shots. Vaccine hesitancy among Republicans has been cited as an impediment to reaching herd immunity in the U.S. A majority of those polled, 61%, said the worse of the pandemic is behind the U.S., against 55% in October who assessed that the worst was yet to come. “To the people of India I want to express my sympathy on the terrible suffering that Covid-19 has again brought over your communities,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a message on Twitter. Germany is urgently preparing a support mission, she said. U.S. cases increased by 53,224 on Saturday, the eighth consecutive day with fewer than 70,000 reported new infections, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg. That compares with peaks of more than 300,000 per day during late December and January. The seven-day average of positive tests for Covid-19 nationwide declined to 5.18% on Thursday, which compares with almost 15% in early January, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Another 723 deaths were reported on Saturday. Bangladesh suspended administering first doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from April 26 on uncertainty about resupply of the drug. The country’s Directorate General of Health Services announced the nationwide suspension on Sunday, and the order will remain in force until further notice. However, those who have received the first dose of the vaccine will still get the second shot on schedule. Iraq’s Interior Ministry said Sunday that 82 people died and 110 were injured in a catastrophic fire that broke out in a Baghdad hospital. Among the dead were at least 28 patients on ventilators battling severe symptoms of the coronavirus, tweeted Ali al-Bayati, a spokesman of the country’s independent Human Rights Commission. The commission is a semi-official body. France is “engaged in a battle against these variants which are a threat from which we must protect ourselves,” Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Sunday, mentioning Brazilian and South African forms of the virus. Castex was speaking during a visit on Sunday to Paris’s Roissy international airport, to highlight protective measures taken by the government including increased filtering and scrutiny, PCR tests and a mandatory quarantine for travelers from high-risk countries. The number of new Covid-19 cases in Germany slowed to 14,422, the lowest in five days, and the number of new deaths was at a six-day low. At the same time, a key pandemic measure watched by the government rose to the highest in months. The so-called seven-day incidence rate, the number of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants reported within seven days, increased to 165.6 on Sunday, the highest since January. The Swiss government estimates that about one-third of the population has been infected with Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. At the end of 2020, government scientists found antibodies in about 20% of those tested and now believe that another 10% have been infected, newspaper NZZ am Sonntag reported. “Conservatively calculated, around a third of the population has been infected since the beginning of the pandemic,” said Federal Office of Public Health spokeswoman, Simone Buchmann. Of the 2.8 million people thought to have already contracted the virus, many are unaware as they showed no symptoms. Only about 650,000 people in the Alpine nation have received positive Covid tests during the pandemic. The Delhi government extended a lockdown in India’s capital until next Monday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said at a press conference Sunday. Delhi is the one of the worst affected regions in the country with hospitals turning away patients due to shortages of oxygen. Delhi needs 700 tons of oxygen while the central government has allotted only 490 tons, Kejriwal said, adding that he was in touch with other states for supplies and expects the shortage to ease in the next two to three days. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the country could continue to provide free vaccines to all state governments and asked them to ensure availability of the doses in remote parts of the nation. India’s home-grown vaccine developer Bharat Biotech International Ltd. priced its coronavirus shots as much as double that of its local competitor, citing high manufacturing costs even as the nation grapples with record infections. The company will sell Covaxin for 600 rupees ($8) a dose to state governments and 1,200 rupees a dose to private hospitals, it said in a statement on Twitter late Saturday. India added 349,691 cases, bringing its total to 16.96 million, the government said Sunday. The country recorded 2,767 Covid-19 related deaths in the past 24 hours, making a total of 192,311 fatalities. The U.S. will send additional support to India in its fight against the most recent Covid-19 outbreak, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a tweet. “We are working closely with our partners in the Indian government, and we will rapidly deploy additional support to the people of India and India’s health care heroes,” Blinken said on Twitter. With the Delhi capital area facing a severe oxygen shortage, Prime Minister Narendra Modi implored Indians to get vaccinated and to disregard rumors about dangerous side-effects. In Baghdad, more than 80 people were killed when a fire tore through a hospital treating patients, including many with coronavirus.

The U.S. recorded 3 million vaccine doses on Sunday, another drop suggesting a general in demand, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. The seven-day average fell to 2.8 million, compared with a record 3.4 million on April 13.  After three months of vaccination across the U.S., a majority of American adults have gotten shots, and the effort will soon shift from mass inoculation to mop-up. The Biden administration is pursuing a strategy of abundance, which the White House has referred to as an “overwhelm the problem” approach. While vaccines will probably still be shipped widely to sits such as pharmacies and health centers, what’s likely to disappear are lines and scarcity.

Meet Sustainable Jet Fuel,['Jack Wittels'],QuickTake,"Workers fill an Airbus A350 passenger plane with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)  at Charles de Gaulle airport in Roissy, on May 18. Today’s airplanes -- and the carbon dioxide they produce -- aren’t a good fit with the clean energy future envisioned to fight global warming. Last year, even with Covid-19 travel restrictions, more than 1.5 billion barrels of aviation fuel were burned, a figure set to more than triple by 2050 as more people take to the skies. Today, that fuel is almost exclusively petroleum-based, but the airline industry is backing a potential solution that means we can all travel without “flying shame.” It’s called sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF for short. Right now though, it’s extremely expensive and there isn’t enough being used to make any meaningful impact on emissions. There are two main types: Once SAF is made -- both the bio-based and synthetic kind -- it can be mixed with oil-based jet fuel and safely used in today’s planes with a blend ratio limit of up to 50%, set by the American Society for Testing and Materials, a standard-setting body. Planemaker Boeing Co. aims to certify its aircraft to fly on 100% SAF by 2030. Today though, where it’s used at all, SAF blend ratios tend to be tiny. In California, airports are estimated to be blending, on average, 0.1% of SAF into their fuel supply, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation. This year, SAF consumption is estimated to be about 120 million liters, according to the International Air Transport Association, the industry’s global trade group. That’s only about 2,000 barrels a day -- a drop in the ocean of the global jet fuel industry. Using SAF could dramatically reduce emissions, though by precisely how much depends on blend ratios and how it’s made. Finland’s Neste Oyj has invested in plants in Europe and Asia to produce bio-based jet fuel and diesel. The company estimates that, in neat form, its SAF cuts lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions -- which take into account the fuel’s production, as well as its consumption -- by up to 80%. Synthetic SAF can be CO2 neutral. So far though, high prices and limited supply mean SAF’s impact on pollution is negligible. SAF made from biomass costs about three times more than conventional aviation fuel, synthetic versions even eight times more, according to a February report from Eurocontrol, an intergovernmental organization focused on air traffic management. Using SAF could also reduce the wispy clouds planes sometimes leave behind them in the sky -- known as contrails -- which can also contribute to global warming by trapping warmer air in the lower atmosphere. Aviation is seen as one of the most difficult industries to decarbonize, though there are several technologies in the works. Electric planes are in development, but the big problem remains the weight-to-energy ratio of batteries, which is much lower than that of jet fuel. Short-range, fully electrified civil aircraft carrying 100-150 passengers are optimistically expected to enter service by 2035-2040. Hydrogen-powered flight is another option. It’s backed by Airbus, though the planemaker has said it only expects to bring a hydrogen aircraft into service by 2035. Yes. The industry is focusing on improvements in design, operation and infrastructure. Carbon offsetting and carbon capture are also seen as potentially significant parts of how the industry will hit its target of halving net CO2 emissions by 2050 compared with 2005. The International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN body that develops policies and standards, has also established a carbon offsetting program known as CORSIA. This is currently a voluntary effort though it’s set to become mandatory in the coming years, with some exceptions. Offsets are also controversial, with uncertainty over whether promised reductions are actually happening. Energy companies and airlines are lining up to back SAF. Neste is modifying refineries in Rotterdam and Singapore, giving it the capacity to produce about 1.5 millions tons of SAF per year by the end of 2023. TotalEnergies SE has started bio-jet production at its La Mede refinery in southern France. Essar Oil UK Ltd., which operates the Stanlow refinery in northwest England, is part of a group of firms planning to produce about 80,000 tons a year of SAF. Royal Dutch Shell Plc has invested in LanzaJet Inc., which is building an alcohol-to-jet facility in the U.S. state of Georgia. Shell is involved in multiple SAF projects, including one with Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc to develop engines that can run on 100% SAF. On the consumption side, IAG SA, the parent of British Airways, has said it will commit to powering 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030 and has committed to net zero CO2 output by 2050. Southwest Airlines Co. has partnered with Marathon Petroleum Corp. and Phillips 66 to facilitate the development and production of SAF. Before the pandemic hit, CO2 emisions from aviation were about 2.4% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions -- including land use change. With air passenger numbers set to recover and then surge in the years to come, that figure is all but certain to rise. The 2050 target of IATA could soon be upped to net-zero carbon emissions. ICAO also has a target of carbon neutral growth for international aviation from 2020. Meanwhile, the European Union is pushing for more regulation, with a raft of measures spanning various sectors set to be announced. The U.K. also plans to begin including international aviation for the first time in its carbon budget -- which is a cap on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted over a five-year period. BIOFUEL: This is fuel made from either biomass materials (such as plants or wood), or waste and residue products (such as used cooking oil and animal fat). It can be made through a process known as the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids, or HEFA approach, which is likely to be the basis of most SAF production this decade. While some biofuels are controversial because of concerns about deforestation and competition with food crops, the switch to SAF will not require large amounts of land or impact food or water use, according to the Air Transport Action Group, which represents the aviation industry. SYNTHETIC FUEL: This is a clean, engineered version of today’s crude-oil based hydrocarbons. They’re made by combining carbon with green hydrogen -- which is hydrogen fuel created with renewable energy -- to create a new fuel. Production of SAF using this technology does not yet exist at scale. Related QuickTakes on flying shame, electric airplanes, and carbon offsets.

New York City’s marriage bureau will reopen on Monday, 16 months after the city closed the department at the start of the pandemic. Most vaccinated Americans are unlikely to need Covid-19 booster shots for months, or even years, despite the rise of highly infectious variants and the continued spread of the virus, according to top scientists. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said misinformation about vaccines and health practices is harming the fight against Covid-19 and called on social-media companies to help turn the tide. “While it often appears innocuous on social media apps, on retail sites or search engines, the truth is that misinformation takes away our freedom to make informed decisions about our health and the health of our loved ones,” Murthy said at a White House news briefing. Social-media companies could help counter misinformation with measures such as stronger monitoring, penalties for accounts that repeatedly violate platform policies and redesigned algorithms to avoid amplifying false claims, Murthy said in a surgeon general’s advisory issued Thursday. Transport Minister Omar Alghabra announced that cruise ships will once again be able to enter Canadian waters as of Nov. 1. Cruise operators, barred since the start of the pandemic, will need to prove they’ll be able to meet public health requirements to be allowed to travel to Canada. “As Canadians have done their part to reduce the spread of Covid-19, our government continues to work hard to safely restart our economy and build back better. We will welcome cruise ships -- an important part of our tourism sector -- back in Canadian waters for the 2022 season,” Alghabra said in an emailed statement. A number of French lawmakers have received death threats due to their backing of the government’s vaccine policy, according to a statement Thursday from the National Assembly. This type of intimidation won’t be tolerated, the statement said, adding that French police have been alerted. President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week increased pressure on people to be vaccinated with a plan to make it mandatory for health-care workers. So-called immunity passes will also be required for entry into venues such as restaurants and cafes. The delta variant has gained ground in France and the number of new cases is rising. Ireland is heading into a “difficult couple of weeks” where Covid cases will spike and hospitalizations will increase, Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar warned, as the country saw its most new cases in five months. There’s concern that unvaccinated people could “overwhelm our hospitals” if they take risks with the virus, Varadkar told lawmakers in Dublin. Hospitalizations rose to their highest level in five weeks, although well below the previous peak in January. Despite the rise in cases, the government has set a target to reopen indoor dining for July 26. Most vaccinated Americans are unlikely to need Covid-19 booster shots for months, or even years, despite the rise of highly infectious variants and the continued spread of the virus, according to top scientists. Pfizer Inc. has been touting a plan to apply for clearance this summer for a third shot of its messenger RNA vaccine. But vaccine experts and health officials in both the U.S. and Europe say that while a booster may eventually be needed, existing shots remain highly effective in preventing severe disease, including against all known variants. Singapore is mulling new measures to curb Covid as it deals with the latest outbreak stemming from karaoke lounges in the city-state. “We are working round the clock to deal with the latest cases, to contain them,” Lawrence Wong, Singapore’s finance minister who co-chairs the city’s Covid task force, said in a Facebook post. The task force will update citizens on the latest measures soon, he said. Singapore reported 42 new cases in the community Thursday, adding to the 56 the previous day. Wong, who expressed disappointment and frustration in his social-media post, asked for those who have been to the lounges to get tested. Meanwhile, police have arrested 20 women suspected of involvement in vice-related activities at the lounges. Portugal said a nighttime curfew will apply to more municipalities as the government tries to contain an increase in infections. The limit to movement in public spaces between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. in regions including Lisbon and the southern Algarve region that are popular with tourists will now be imposed in 90 municipalities, up from 60 previously, Presidency Minister Mariana Vieira da Silva said on Thursday. The government in June began to face a surge in infections around Lisbon, where the delta variant had a high incidence, and had to halt a plan to continue gradually easing confinement measures across the country. The World Health Organization’s director general called on China to cooperate in a second phase of studying the origins of the coronavirus as the pandemic rages on around the world. One of the challenges is the lack of raw data, especially from the early days of the outbreak, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a media briefing Thursday. China hasn’t yet shared that information. “We’re asking China to be transparent and open and cooperate,” Tedros said. New York City’s marriage bureau will reopen on Monday, 16 months after the city shut the department at the start of the pandemic. The city’s five marriage bureaus had been closed since March 2020 due to health and safety concerns, despite the reopening of most other municipal offices and the return to office buildings by city employees. The city has been holding virtual ceremonies, but a deluge of requests led to months-long waits. Health officials in southwest Missouri asked the state to set up an “alternate site” to handle overflowing hospitalizations caused by a spike in new virus cases. The state is one of the worst hit by the delta variant, particularly around the city of Springfield and surrounding Greene County. “Today, there are 231 patients being treated in Greene County hospitals with Covid-19, 104 of those are in critical care and 61 are on ventilators,” read a statement released Wednesday night by officials from the city, county and three health care networks. “Greene County is averaging more than 196 cases per day, and the increase in severe illness is projected to outpace hospital capacity.” In Missouri, 46.1% of people have received at least one dose of vaccine, compared with the national average of 55.7%, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. The U.S. delivered 500,000 doses of Moderna Inc.’s vaccine to Haiti, and the Biden administration plans to send additional doses soon, according to a White House official, who said the shipments don’t come with strings attached. Haiti has been dealing with the aftermath of the assassination of its president, Jovenel Moise, on July 7, including a power struggle and unrest in the impoverished Caribbean nation. A rolling review of the antibody cocktail from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Roche Holding AG is moving “quite rapidly,” said Marco Cavaleri, head of biological health threats and vaccines strategy at the European Medicines Agency. A decision on marketing authorization is possible by year-end or sooner, he said. CureVac NV will probably be able to submit for review the data package from its Covid vaccine clinical trials “toward the end of the summer,” Cavaleri said. South Africa should prepare for a surge in cases after days of widespread rioting and looting in the two most populous provinces, said Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization’s Africa director. The deadliest and most widespread unrest since the end of apartheid followed the imprisonment of former President Jacob Zuma on July 7. The looting spree has occurred amid the country’s third and most severe wave of Covid-19 infections. Deaths from Covid-19 in Africa as a whole rose 40% in the last week and hospitals are now at “breaking point,” Moeti said. The continent is in the grip of its most severe wave of coronavirus infections yet, with an additional million cases recorded over the last month compared with the three months it took for the previous million to accumulate, she said. Tokyo logged 1,308 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, the most in six months, with just over a week remaining until the Olympics kick off on July 23. Serious cases also increased to 57 from 54 the previous day. Tokyo’s daily record stands at 2,520 new cases on Jan. 7. People in their 20s and 30s accounted for most of the new cases. Cases among older people have dwindled amid the acceleration of Japan’s vaccination drive, which has prioritized the elderly. About 71% of Tokyoites aged 65 or older had received at least one shot of either Pfizer or Moderna’s vaccine as of July 7, while younger age groups are yet to catch up. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach, visiting Japan ahead of the Olympic opening ceremony, said Wednesday that measures against the virus are in place and working. He said about 85% of the residents in the Olympic Village will arrive in Japan vaccinated and nearly 100% of the IOC members and staff will be as well. Saudi Arabia’s daily coronavirus vaccination rate has accelerated to more than 400,000 ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline that would ban those without at least one dose from entry to most places except homes. Long lines were visible this week in the capital Riyadh at clinics administering vaccines. Saudi Arabia’s fully vaccinated rate still lags behind some of its smaller Gulf neighbors. About 8.4% of the population has received two doses of the Pfizer or Astrazeneca vaccines in the kingdom. New cases in Tokyo reached the highest in six months, about a week before the Olympics are scheduled to start. A Utah pharmacist lost his license after admitting to giving vaccination cards to about half a dozen people whom he didn’t inoculate, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. The pharmacist was caught on a surveillance camera writing down the manufacturing lot number from a vial of vaccine on a card and giving it to a patient without administering a shot, the paper reported, citing a stipulation order.

Lithuania accused Belarus of allowing illegal migrants to cross its borders into the European Union -- the latest sign of simmering tensions after a Ryanair Holdings Plc was forced to land in Minsk last month so the authorities there could arrest an opposition journalist. The EU was swift to sanction the former Soviet republic in the wake of the jet incident, which sparked outrage across most of the continent and in the U.S. Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko threatened last week in a speech to send drugs and illegal migrants into the EU unchecked. That’s already happening, according to Lithuanian border-control data released Wednesday, which showed the number of illegal migrants -- mostly from Iraq -- crossing from Belarus jumping to 189 in the first five months of 2021 from 81 in the whole of last year. Similar flows of Chechens and Syrians have been registered in Poland, which along with Lithuania is among the most-vocal critics of Belarus following a 2020 election deemed illegitimate by most European countries. The press service of Belarus’s state border control committee didn’t answer phone calls seeking comment on the crossings. “What’s worrying is that when the Belarusian side is asked about illegal migrants on our side, we get answers that no, they don’t see anything,” Lithuanian Interior Minister Agne Bilotaite told parliament. “This is a sign that it’s a deliberate policy and deliberate actions against the Lithuanian state.”"

Pandemic fallout is complicating the trip. Students at the Thompson Library on the first day of classes at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, on Aug. 25, 2020.  Students from around the world are eager to study at U.S. colleges in the upcoming fall semester after the Covid-19 pandemic confined many of them to their home countries and left some attending virtual classes in the wee hours of the morning. Now, getting to campus is the hard part. Enjoying Bloomberg Wealth? To read more articles based on your personal financial goals, answer these 3 questions that will tailor your reading experience. In China, which accounts for a third of the roughly 1 million foreign students that flock to the U.S. in a typical academic year, the decline in available flights to American cities has been so severe that some students and their parents have resorted to lining up charter planes. Others, including from India, are caught up in visa purgatory because the State Department reduced personnel at embassies and consulates due to the pandemic. And that's to say nothing of fast-changing Covid-19 vaccine guidelines. It all adds up to tangle of challenges that has created uncertainty for students and a potential headache for schools that are looking to blunt  last year’s sharp drop in international enrollment and the attending financial hit.   Ohio State University, which drew almost 6,600 international students to its Columbus campus in the fall of 2019, has already begun to see requests to defer for the term that begins Aug. 24, said Carina Hansen, who directs the International Students and Scholars program.  International students bring a worldly perspective to campuses and, crucially, often pay full tuition. Widespread deferrals would be a blow to colleges and universities, which dealt with a  16% decline in international student enrollment in this year’s spring term from the previous year because of the pandemic.  “If they defer for the semester, there's always the concern that you'll lose them for good,” said Don Heller, vice president of operations at the University of San Francisco who studies higher education finance. “If it's easier for them to get into Canada, they might decide to go to a university in Canada instead, or stay in their home country.” Anticipating potential problems with travel and other factors, Northeastern University in Boston held more than 200 virtual support sessions — in a half dozen languages, across multiple time zones — to answer questions about vaccines, visas and requests for travel support letters for airlines, said Renata Nyul, a spokeswoman. Chinese students are finding the airline industry’s fitful recovery from the pandemic is making the trip to the U.S. trickier to plan, with a 96% decline in seats from two years ago. In July, there are 61 flights, or 20,254 seats, going from China to the U.S., according to Cirium, an aviation data company. That is far lower than the 1,626 flights, or 479,519, seats, making that voyage in July 2019. Flights from China may come with an eye-popping price tag, too: The average cost of a round-trip ticket from that country to the U.S. was $2,260 in the first two quarters of 2021, according to travel-management company TripActions, a big jump from the $1,247 average fare seen in the same period in 2019.  Alicia Zhang, 20, took a gamble by buying a ticket for a direct flight in late June from her hometown, Shanghai, to New York, where she's a rising junior studying economics at New York University. The price — about $4,000 for a one-way ticket — was roughly five times greater than what she had paid in pre-pandemic times. It didn't pay off: She said the China Eastern Airlines flight was canceled less than a month later, with a refund. She then purchased a seat on another flight, with a layover in Hong Kong, for about $4,500. She said many students fear that the course of the pandemic this summer could prompt airlines to reconsider their schedules, potentially leading to cancellations or changes.  ""The biggest problem will be the ticket,"" Zhang said. ""Most of my friends will buy several tickets and just wait for which ticket is not canceled, and just go to that flight."" After trading stories of pricey airfares or worries about flight cancellations in WeChat groups organized by the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, some students and their parents lined up charter flights with Cathay Pacific, including two flights to New York in August. The group helps Chinese students studying abroad, especially in the U.S. ""We don't have many choices,"" said Samantha Duan, 18, an incoming NYU student from Chengdu who is traveling to the U.S. for the first time on one of the charter flights. This option offers some certainty, a more attractive price, and the fun of traveling with other students. For those that don’t opt for charter flights, the ever-changing circumstances of the pandemic make it hard to game out when fares might be most affordable.  “An uptick in ticket prices should indeed be expected given airlines will be looking to tap the surge in demand from students over the short August/September window,” said Chris Muckensturm, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst who studies passenger transportation in the Asia Pacific region, in an e-mail. “Yet more capacity deployed on those routes could mitigate price increases.” For some students, the primary difficulty isn’t the flight, but obtaining a visa. According to a State Department website that offers guidance on appointment wait times, the situation varies widely across the globe. For those looking to obtain student and exchange visas, estimates range from three calendar days in Beijing and 36 days in Seoul to emergency appointments only in Shanghai, Mumbai and London. The State Department says it is prioritizing visa applications for certain types of travelers, including students and exchange visitors.   Read More: State Department Warns of Passport Backlog of Up to 18 Weeks Sara Dahiya, 17, an incoming freshman at Harvard University from Panipat, India, is among the students awaiting her visa. She expects to depart for the U.S. this fall alongside her twin brother, Anirudh, who will begin at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She and her brother purchased their plane tickets in mid-June. ""It definitely was a risk to book my flight before getting a visa but I'm glad I took it,"" Dahiya wrote in an email. ""The process of scheduling a visa appointment, as it is, was extremely distressing, and finding and paying twice the amount for a flight right now would've only added to the troubles."" Colleges have ample incentive to move away from remote learning this fall. Beyond the potential educational rewards of in-person schooling, there are financial benefits to these institutions, because payments for living in dormitory housing and  eating in dining halls help cushion their bottom lines.  International students studying at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $38.7 billion to the nation’s economy and supported 415,996 jobs during the 2019-2020 academic year, according to an analysis by NAFSA: Association of International Educators. Last year, when campuses shut down in March, many students were stranded far from home. If they did eventually depart the U.S., they might have ended up taking classes online at odd hours, thanks to time-zone differences.   “International students probably took the hardest hit in the pandemic,” said Wendy Wolford, vice provost for international affairs and a professor of global development at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Paulash Chatterjee, a rising senior at the University of Illinois-Chicago, has attended school from his home in Jaipur, India, since last August, located 7,500 miles away from campus in a time zone that is 10.5 hours ahead. He plans to resume in-person learning in the fall, but is concerned about the cost of airfare and the possibility that his flight might end up canceled. He also must consider Covid-19 vaccine recommendations. He received his first dose of the Indian vaccine Covishield in June, but evolving government advice now suggests that a later administration of his second vaccine dose — up to 16 weeks after the first — would offer better protection. That’s long after Chatterjee is set to be in the U.S.  ""I've been checking flights every day,"" said Chatterjee, 21, who is studying biology. ""Of course I want to go back to Chicago, but at the same time, I don't want to risk my life."""

Coupled with accelerating cases in the South, the finding casts a pall on the inoculation effort in the country even though more than 45% of the population has been fully vaccinated against Covid-19. South Africa is planning to make vaccines locally using messenger RNA, the breakthrough technology of the global inoculation effort against Covid-19. The manufacturing will be conducted by the state-owned Biovac Institute, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, told reporters Monday. That will be part of a broader vaccine technology-transfer hub in the country, he said. The WHO is speaking to a number of drugmakers about establishing the hub, though the talks are so far mainly with “smaller companies,” said Soumya Swaminathan, WHO’s chief scientist. “We are having discussions with the larger companies with proven mRNA technology,” she added. The U.S. said 150 million Americans have been fully vaccinated, according to a statement on Twitter by Cyrus Shahpar, White House Covid data director.

Tedros, who said his organization is speaking to a consortium of companies to establish the hub, spoke at a press conference on Monday. The Canadian government announced a loosening of Covid-19 travel restrictions for fully vaccinated people amid warnings that a return to a completely open border will take awhile longer. Fully vaccinated Canadians and residents will exempt from the mandatory three-day hotel stay as well as a 14-day quarantine requirement on arrival to the country, Justin Trudeau’s government said in a statement on Monday. Travelers will still need to have tested negative for Covid-19 before their trip, and take a second test at the border. The move -- effective July 5 -- is a first, incremental step to ease restrictions amid mounting impatience for the government to reopen the border between the U.S. and Canada. A fuller reopening won’t happen until 75% of Canadians are fully vaccinated, Canada’s border chief said on Sunday. The world’s longest undefended border has been closed to most travel since March 2020. On Friday, the government extended the restrictions until at least July 21. German Health Minister Jens Spahn warned of the possibility of a fourth wave of the pandemic as the delta variant spreads, saying it’s important to remain cautious as the country plans for a potentially challenging autumn and winter. “As you can see in the U.K., there is a risk,” Spahn said in an online panel hosted by industry group BDI. “Just remember the figures they had just some weeks ago regarding vaccination as well as the infection rate, and actually how quickly that can change.” South Africa, France and the World Health Organization are set to announce plans for Africa’s first Covid-19 vaccine facility using messenger RNA, the breakthrough technology of the global inoculation effort. The “technology transfer hub” will be located in South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa’s office said in a statement on Monday. The announcement is scheduled for 5 p.m. local time. South Africa, along with India, has been at the forefront of a campaign at the World Trade Organization to push pharmaceutical companies to waive their intellectual property rights and share their technology for Covid-19 vaccines and treatments to help end the pandemic. Kenya will receive 358,000 AstraZeneca doses donated by Denmark on Monday to shore up depleting stocks for the second round of vaccinations, according to Willis Akhwale, chairman of the Covid-19 vaccine advisory task force. A total of 1.18 million vaccines have so far been administered across Kenya, but fewer than 200,000 people had received a second dose as at June 20, according to the Health Ministry. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said England is on course to be able to lift coronavirus restrictions as planned on July 19, despite the spread of the delta variant. But Johnson also warned that foreign travel is likely to continue to be disrupted this year, with delays and complications for travelers. The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority said an application by Sinovac Biotech Ltd. to have its Coronavac vaccine approved “is at a very advanced stage.” So far South Africa has only approved the Pfizer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for use. Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine is also being evaluated. Britain’s surging coronavirus infection rate is widening a rift between airlines and health authorities over the government’s decision to maintain some of the tightest rules on travel in Europe. Travel industry officials plan to hold events on Wednesday in London, Edinburgh and Belfast to draw attention to some 195,000 jobs they say are at risk from restrictions on overseas trips. Meanwhile, an adviser from Public Health England warned that a fourth national lockdown may be needed this year to control the virus. Indonesia’s total Covid-19 cases reached 2 million and hospitals started to fill up as the country grapples with the highly transmissible delta variant. The government confirmed 14,536 new cases on Monday, a record. Deaths have begun to pick up as the Covid-19 hospitalization rates exceed 70% in 87 cities across the country, with 294 fatalities recorded in the past 24 hours. China needs to fully vaccinate 80%-85% of the population, or just over 1 billion people, to reach herd immunity, the nation’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told state media on Monday. The world’s most populous country has already administered 1 billion doses, but most were Sinovac and Sinopharm that require two jabs. China’s “covid-zero” containment strategy means it’s still being cautious about opening its borders and loosening quarantine restrictions. Administration. Canada announced a loosening of travel restrictions for fully vaccinated people. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said England is on track for curbs to be lifted in July, while Germany warned a fourth wave is possible.

The Tokyo Olympics will limit the number of spectators to 10,000 people per venue. Covid-19 transmission is accelerating in several poorly vaccinated states, primarily in the South, and more young people are turning up at hospitals. The data present the clearest sign of a rebound in the U.S. in months. In Missouri, Arkansas and Utah, the seven-day average of hospital admissions with confirmed Covid-19 has increased more than 30% in the past two weeks, according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.

The EU261 rule, which sets out reimbursements for flight cancellations and delays, was onerous even before the pandemic struck, executives said at the Airlines 4 Europe’s annual meeting Thursday. They argued that it isn’t compatible with the mass groundings forced on companies during the crisis. “It’s probably one of the most punitive protection-rights laws in the world,” Air France-KLM Chief Executive Officer Ben Smith said in a joint webinar with the heads of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, British Airways owner IAG SA, Ryanair Holdings Plc and EasyJet Plc. “It’s very important that we move along to evolve this law to something that is more realistic and more balanced.” Many European airlines sought to rebook passengers to hang on to cash as Covid-19 roiled global travel. While many passengers rescheduled, carriers ultimately had to make payouts to those who demanded it under the EU rule. The European Commission has been mulling revisions to EU261, which was introduced in 2005, for eight years, though changes haven’t been implemented. “The pandemic has been incredibly tough for airlines but weakening vital consumer rights protections for millions of holidaymakers is completely the wrong approach to solving the industry’s problems,” said Rory Boland, the travel editor for consumer advocacy group Which? While the group supports greater government support for the airline industry, Boland said the experience of Covid-19, has reinforced the case for reforms “to strengthen passenger rights and ensure airlines and travel operators face real consequences when they break the rules.” Despite the law, refunds for millions of people were withheld illegally by airlines and travel firms, Boland said.  Regulators have fielded complaints from people who struggled to collect cash refunds for flights they were unable to take. In the U.K., Ryanair and British Airways face an investigation into whether they broke consumer rules by failing to offer customers their money back.

The EU General Court, the bloc’s second-highest tribunal, on Wednesday said the European Commission’s decision gave “an inadequate statement of reasons” for approving the measure. But in light of the “economic and social context marked by the Covid-19 pandemic,” judges put on hold any order to repay the aid until after the EU’s antitrust arm has re-examined the case and issued a new decision fixing the procedural errors. Investor Attestor Ltd. last month acquired a majority stake in the German airline, rescuing a company that’s survived on government support after the coronavirus pandemic punctured the boom in air travel. The EU-approved German loan Ryanair is contesting helped keep Condor afloat. Ryanair has filed more than two dozen challenges to EU approvals for pandemic aid doled out by governments to carriers, including Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Air France-KLM. “During the Covid-19 pandemic over 30 billion euros in discriminatory state subsidies has been gifted to EU flag carriers,” Ryanair said in a statement. “Unless halted by the EU Courts in line with today’s ruling, the effects of market distortion caused by this state aid will be felt for decades.” The Brussels-based commission said it “will carefully study the judgment and reflect on next steps,” noting the court’s decision “to suspend the effects” of the ruling until a possible new EU decision on the aid. The Irish low-cost carrier, which last month won two of its other challenges, argued that the aid for selected airlines creates an unfair advantage and will help rivals to emerge stronger, slash fares and swallow up others.

Mexican viewers didn’t know it from watching President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s daily discourse, but Mexico was becoming one of the world’s deadliest Covid hot spots. The government’s alternate version of reality included an undercounting of cases and deaths, something it belatedly acknowledged in March when it announced that Covid-related deaths were  far higher than the  official count, which stood at about 234,000 as of July 5. More expansive estimates can be derived from excess deaths, the epidemiological term for increased mortality compared with an average year. In one such analysis, the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics & Evaluation places Mexico’s Covid deaths at about 540,000. During his morning broadcast on Jan. 18, López Obrador swerved around an uncomfortable truth: Pfizer had just shunted Mexico to the back of the line for limited supplies while it  closed a plant in Belgium for upgrades. He spun a different tale: that he was altruistically acceding to a (nonexistent) request by the United Nations to give up shots so Pfizer could boost production to supply poorer nations “that don’t have the economic possibility to buy vaccines.” AMLO, as the president is known, claimed that he approved the Pfizer cut because “it would be unjust and inhumane and contradictory” not to. “We have to walk together, be supportive,” he said. On his YouTube channel, the news conference was titled “Redistribution of Covid-19 vaccines is an act of solidarity.” What was actually happening was entirely out of Mexico’s hands. Yes, Pfizer’s retooling of its Belgian factory would eventually lead to greater global supply. But in the short term, the company  made decisions about where it would send its vials and where it wouldn’t. It chose to make cuts in Latin America and Europe while sending millions of shots to  Israel. The difference was that Israel had just signed a data-sharing deal with Pfizer, which would flood the country with its vaccine to test its  real-world effectiveness—good for science and, of course, Pfizer. The methods of estimating Covid’s true death toll vary, but study after study show Mexico among the world’s hardest-hit countries. For average monthly excess deaths during the pandemic, Mexico is third, behind Ecuador and Peru, according to a Bloomberg analysis of figures collected by Our World in Data. (As of July 6, Mexico has about 54% more deaths on average than over the previous five years; Ecuador is at 67% and Peru at 136%.) In other published tallies, Mexico has ranked third or fourth in the world for total excess deaths. The president’s office and the health ministry didn’t respond to requests for comment about the government’s handling of the pandemic. Last winter the carnage in Mexico City was palpable. Black smoke billowed around the clock from overwhelmed cemetery crematoriums. Funereal bottlenecks forced families to take the remains of their loved ones to other parts of the country for timely disposal. In hospitals the bodies were backlogged on gurneys and in autopsy rooms. It took until May for Mexico’s hospitalizations to drop to 13% of capacity, from 90% in January, and the positivity rate, once the world’s highest at roughly 50%, to fall to 17%. “Many patients didn’t have a chance to even make it to a hospital or wound up in a hospital that wasn’t prepared,” says Francisco Moreno, head of internal medicine at Centro Médico ABC, one of Mexico’s most prestigious private medical institutions. “What I saw was a total collapse of the health system.” And yet, to the world and even some Mexicans, it’s almost as if it never happened. If you didn’t know that an extraordinary number of people had perished only months ago, it would be easy to see just another sunny summer on the horizon, with bustling boulevards and packed beaches. Some of this collective amnesia is due in part to the actions AMLO never took: While Europe is publicly wrestling with how to reopen to foreign tourism, Mexico never closed air travel from any countries or required any testing or quarantines from visitors. But the forgetting doesn’t mean it didn’t happen—or can’t happen again, soon.  Mexico’s strategy, which has never officially changed, both failed to keep the virus’s spread in check and meant the country’s death toll escaped wide notice. When researchers tried to put together more accurate numbers, the government erected barriers. Some researchers had been able to cobble together a rough count of excess deaths in Mexico City based on death certificates, having noticed they were sequentially numbered. The idea was, if you know the latest number on the certificates, you know how many are dead. In March the authorities thwarted that workaround: The certificates were no longer searchable by number, only by name. There are no longer independently available statistics on excess mortality. Mexico’s second big mistake was AMLO’s refusal to raise debt to pay for fiscal stimulus or aid to the poor, as the leaders of most major economies did. This reflected the  economic quirks of the president himself, who’s never possessed a credit card in his name. The son of fabric shop owners from the state of Tabasco, AMLO has shunned luxuries and refused to fly on the presidential Boeing 787 Dreamliner—he’s been  trying to sell it from his first day in office. His political philosophy was shaped by the disastrous debt default of 1982, which brought inflation to 115%, and the Tequila Crisis of 1994, which produced a sudden devaluation of the peso and a recession. His government’s spending commitments for Covid relief amount to about 0.7% of gross domestic product—less than a third of the average for other developing countries in the Group of 20, the International Monetary Fund says. And those programs have largely been microloans to small businesses. While other countries essentially paid workers to stay home and supported companies so they could preserve jobs, Mexico’s policies had the effect of keeping people in circulation to earn a living. Arturo Herrera, AMLO’s outgoing finance minister, argues that the administration saved Mexico from weakened public finances that would have had worse repercussions down the road, leading to cuts in social services. Had Mexico spent like Canada or Germany did on Covid stimulus, he said in a February  interview with Bloomberg News, the additional debt would have exceeded all government funding for public universities and high schools. AMLO has also argued that his government inherited a broken hospital system and had to expand its capacity in a short time period to handle the health crisis, which is where it focused much of its attention, rather than on testing. Throughout the first wave, in the spring and summer of 2020, Hugo López-Gatell, the nation’s virus czar, kept saying Mexico was beating back the outbreak, though it wasn’t. “The epidemic is slowing down,” he declared in a May 5, 2020, news conference. “We’ve flattened the curve.” When confronted with data showing the curve was in fact continuing to go up, he said what he really meant was the slope would have been steeper if it weren’t for the social distancing policies he’d implemented. When a second wave of infections hit Mexico City toward the end of 2020, he and the mayor resisted ordering a shutdown, even as the city’s hospitals overflowed with patients. In January the government denied that the capital’s hospitals were full. Yet Bloomberg News found that paramedics had to drive their ambulances around through the night to  find scarce unoccupied beds. The midnight searches for beds were among the worst tales the city’s doctors, nurses, and paramedics described during the height of the second wave. One patient waited 11 hours in an ambulance, running through several oxygen tanks, until a bed was available. A medic drove a patient six hours to Aguascalientes state, northwest of Mexico City, to find a bed. A hospital ran out of the medication it used to sedate patients being fitted with ventilators. Doctor Gerardo Ivan Cervantes, head of epidemiology at Hospital MAC, in the central Mexican city of San Miguel de Allende, describes a harrowing event at another facility. Suddenly four patients couldn’t breathe on their own, sending the hospital into a scramble to buy ventilators for them. As staff searched for the equipment, doctors took turns manually pumping oxygen into the patients’ failing lungs with hand-squeezed bag masks. “There were four people pumping for each patient,” Cervantes says. “It’s too tiring for just one person.” The effort dragged on until the ventilators arrived four hours later. For Cervantes, it was just one of many long stretches in close contact with the coronavirus; he treats more than 10 Covid patients a day. Months later he’s in another long stretch: waiting to get a vaccine.  A week later the New Year’s adventures of virus czar López-Gatell provoked doubts about the Mexican government’s credibility in leading the way out of the crisis. Before the holidays, López-Gatell, who’s also deputy health minister, had told citizens to stay home to curtail infection. Yet in a photo taken on Dec. 31 as he boarded a flight to the beach resort of Huatulco, López-Gatell, ready for relaxation in a tennis cap and gray fleece, is seen standing with his mask pulled below his chin, talking on his phone. The photo went viral on Mexican social media, followed by a second shot of him sitting under the thatched roof of a beach restaurant with a woman,  both of them maskless, as waves broke onto the nearby sand. López-Gatell defended his actions, saying he went to visit family and obeyed local restrictions, which were more relaxed than those in Mexico City. On Jan. 6, AMLO praised him in his daily televised news conference, calling him “honest, honorable” as the epidemiologist’s smiling face was projected onto a wall. AMLO called attention to his czar’s studies at Johns Hopkins University. “A doctorate and a postdoctorate from this prestigious U.S. university. One of the most prestigious!” he said. “On top of that, he’s a specialist in pandemics, prepared—and cultured.” The episode reached a predictable end weeks later when the Covid czar himself  became ill with Covid. In the midst of this came the almost-monthlong Pfizer drought, which began after the shipment of Jan. 19. According to an analysis performed for Bloomberg Businessweek by epidemiologist Shaun Truelove at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the loss of vaccines during that critical period resulted in about 3,500 deaths in Mexico. “Imagine the uncertainty at that moment,” says Deputy Foreign Minister Martha Delgado. “If you don’t have any for three weeks, even if it wouldn’t have been a large amount, it was very onerous, above all because of everything we had prepared, the entire vaccine operation. And public opinion.” Pfizer said in a statement that it advised governments in advance of the factory upgrade and completed it in two weeks. The upgrade allowed the company to meet global delivery commitments in the first quarter and exceed them in the second quarter. It also contributed to Pfizer’s ability to revise its projected 2021 global output from 1.3 billion doses at the start of the year to its current target of 3 billion, the company said. After Pfizer’s delay, Mexico scrambled to strike vaccine deals with China, Cuba, and Russia. AMLO had himself  caught Covid and was convalescing at his presidential residence on Jan. 25 when he held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mexico did a fast-track approval of the Russian Sputnik V shot. On Feb. 2 the Mexican government said it had secured 1.4 million doses of Sputnik, an additional 8 million of China’s CanSino Biologics vaccine, and up to 2.7 million  AstraZeneca shots through Covax, the  global distribution program for poorer countries. On Feb. 8, just days after AMLO returned to work, he announced that he’d struck deals with China’s ambassador to Mexico for additional Chinese vaccines. In another deal, his government started  negotiating with Cuba to participate in trials of a vaccine developed there. On Feb. 14, Mexico received 870,000 AstraZeneca doses from India. That let Mexico start vaccinating its older adults. Pfizer doses, 491,400 of them, finally arrived on Feb. 16 on  DHL jets from Belgium. By then, Mexico’s daily deaths had doubled since the start of the year, to a record high of 1,800. But the vaccine campaign relaunch was problematic. AMLO, the man who disdains urban elites, made a show of sending shots to remote mountain villages and to every state, instead of focusing on urban infection hot spots. And though they’ve pocketed Mexico’s money, some pharmaceutical companies haven’t yet delivered, in part because of global production problems but also because they put Mexico toward the end of the line. AstraZeneca Plc has delivered just 28% of the doses it pledged will reach Mexico by the end of August. Russia has sent just 4.1 million of the 24 million Sputnik doses AMLO initially said had been promised by the end of March. Pfizer appears to be on track, having sent almost two-thirds of the doses due by yearend. Mexicans’ desperation for the shots has at times been comical; there have been reports of people in their 30s dyeing their hair and eyebrows gray and using fake IDs to try to get shots meant for senior citizens. It’s also driven hundreds of thousands of wealthier Mexicans over the border to receive shots in the U.S. Mexico’s travel agent association says members have sold more than 170,000 vacation packages to people looking to fly to get shots. Front-line medical workers were supposed to be vaccinated first, but many are still waiting. That includes Cervantes, the physician who squeezed a bag mask for four hours to keep patients alive. On May 8 he stood in line at a facility in Guanajuato state from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m., when it ran out of shots. He returned home unvaccinated, and perhaps even more in danger because of the crush of hopeful medical workers. “We were exposed, because the line was long and there wasn’t room to keep our distance,” he says. As of press time, he still hadn’t been vaccinated.  Five days earlier, Mexican customs agents and soldiers searching a private airplane at the Campeche airport had found a white cooler chest wedged between two seats. In the chest were sodas, an ice cream sandwich, and, farther down amid the ice cubes, a plastic bag filled with vials of what appeared to be the Sputnik vaccine. In all, the cooler, plus a second one found on board, contained 1,155 vials, with the equivalent of 5,775 doses. The Russian company that distributes Sputnik said the vaccines were fake. The aircraft’s destination, according to the Mexican military, was Honduras, raising the possibility that any fakery has gone regional. People don’t take a chance on black-market vaccines when they believe their government is ready and able to take care of them. The UN’s Mexico office has issued fraud alerts about people posing as UN or World Health Organization officials trying to sell vaccines. Mexico’s health regulator warned against WhatsApp alerts that tell older adults false places to get shots in Mexico City. It was in May that things began to feel normal in Mexico. By early June the country was administering doses from six different vaccine makers, including CanSino and AstraZeneca shots that are locally produced (and, in the case of AstraZeneca, exported regionally after a long delay). Pfizer had increased deliveries. Vaccine distribution had been adjusted so more doses were going to places with more cases. Covid clinics were shutting down, testing centers offered discounts, and Mexico City had lifted almost all restrictions—the city was excited by reports that concert halls and other cultural institutions would open soon. On June 2, 1 million vaccinations were given, and by the end of the month, about 26% of the population was covered with at least one shot. In an example of what the government can accomplish when the incentives are sufficiently powerful, 79% of adults in Baja California had received at least one dose. The goal is to open the border with California. That foreign tourism never stopped only bolsters the sheen of normalcy (though the inaction probably helped bring in the virus via U.S. beachgoers). And the lack of regulations to reverse just helps feed the national amnesia. For those who survived, the president’s relentless optimism has largely worked. The latest polls show an approval rating of 56%. AMLO’s vaccination program has an approval rating of 62%."

The trustee of bonds issued by EA Partners I and II -- two special purpose entities set up by the Abu Dhabi-based carrier -- hired Barclays Bank Plc to arrange the sale, according to a statement. Potential buyers will be able to access documentation on June 21 and the auction will take place within two weeks, it said. Air Berlin, Alitalia and India’s Jet Airways have since filed for insolvency, while creditors have so far failed to reach an agreement over Air Seychelles’s debt with the local government. Investors in EA Partners I received just 43% of their money when the notes came due last year. The EA Partners II’s bondholders also received just a portion of the money owed when the notes matured earlier this month. Bondholders including BlueBay Asset Management, Sandglass Capital Advisors, Sancta Capital and VR Global Partners have been unable to bring Etihad to the negotiating table over the last two years, as the carrier doesn’t recognize the debt as its own. Etihad sold $1.2 billion of bonds between 2015 and 2016 with the help of financier Lars Windhorst and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to prop up loss-making airlines in which it owned stakes. The notes ended up in restructuring after Etihad changed its strategy and pulled the plug on its support for the airlines."

The plan published earlier this month by a task force to restart overseas trips didn’t set out the detail required, the House of Commons Transport Committee said in a report published Thursday. The government has set a goal of restarting leisure travel by May 17 but hasn’t made a final decision to move ahead. U.K. in Regular Talks With U.S. Over Potential Travel Corridor U.S. Airlines’ Summer Dreams at Risk on Blanket No-Go Advice The group asked the government to define by May 1 how countries will be moved between categories in the so-called traffic-light system that will govern border restrictions. They also want a more affordable alternative to PCR tests, which the government has acknowledged are an obstacle to travel. The pressure comes amid a toughening outlook for a travel industry that ground to a virtual halt last year. On Wednesday, the International Air Transport Association said airlines will lose $48 billion this year, with Europe being the slowest region to recover. This week, the U.K. added India to a list of countries with which travel is banned after coronavirus cases there surged. The U.K. has said it aims to decide by early next month whether Britons can resume foreign holidays by the target date. It’s said it must look at the data closer to that time before making a commitment.  Airlines and travel companies have been urging the government to set out a clear date and define clear criteria for the country categories, so they can plan schedules and get people to commit to trips. In its report, the committee also called on the government to deploy more border staff at airports to reduce wait times. The government is working on a plan to make digital vaccine passports that show proof of a jab available by the middle of next month, the Telegraph reported earlier. The traffic-light system will classify countries into green, amber and red based on Covid-19 infection and vaccination rates. Travelers to green countries will still have to take PCR tests, which are more expensive than lateral-flow assessments, before departure and on return to the U.K. The cost of providing a negative result could add 500 pounds ($696) to the budget of a family of four traveling to places where the vaccine rollout is comparable to the U.K.’s, the committee said. The U.K. banned international travel for most people at the beginning of the year as part of lockdown measures put in place to stem the spread of the pandemic."

The Push to Bridge the Atlantic Divide,"['Layan Odeh', 'Siddharth Vikram Philip']",Travel,"A full reopening of aviation’s most lucrative flying routes rests with the U.S. The lucrative North Atlantic flight corridor that links European tourism and business meccas like Paris and London with the U.S. has been starved for traffic for the past 18 months, depriving some of the world’s biggest airlines of revenue from their most profitable journeys.  Now carriers including  Emirates,  United Airlines Holdings Inc. and British Airways are gearing up again, with plans to boost transatlantic seat capacity by 40% collectively in the eight weeks through Aug. 23, according to data from flight tracking firm OAG.  It’s not a sure gamble. The delta variant of the coronavirus has spread to more countries, clouding the outlook for a further progress toward a reopening of the vital routes.  Since late June, European Union countries including Italy, Spain and Greece have allowed American tourists to enter again if they’ve been vaccinated or meet other conditions like testing Covid-free. Starting as soon as late July, the U.K. -- home to Europe’s most important transatlantic hub at London Heathrow airport -- separately plans to allow arrivals from the U.S. and other countries rated medium for Covid-19 risk to come in without quarantine if they’ve been inoculated. But the U.S. hasn’t yet reciprocated, so Europeans still aren’t allowed to vacation in New York, Los Angeles or Miami. With the delta variant adding a new layer of risk, hopes are fading that the Biden administration will act before the summer high season is over. Calls are growing to ignore the rising case loads and allow vaccinated people to travel, since health officials are increasingly confident that they are at little risk of serious illness or spreading the disease.  “Our two continents have been kept apart during the pandemic by sometimes justified, sometimes unjustified actions by our political masters,’’ Henrik Hololei, director general for transportation at the European Commission, said at a joint event with U.S. officials this week. “Now, when the vaccination process is well underway on both shores of the Atlantic, there should be no excuse not to open up for people who want to travel, see their relatives and friends, or just new and old places.” The biggest airlines that ply the North Atlantic are all boosting capacity in anticipation of a surge in demand. British Airways, owned by  IAG SA, has set plans to more than quadruple the number of seats it will offer over the coming weeks, according to data from OAG — setting it up for a potential letdown if there’s no breakthrough. The carrier said it continues to review its schedule, and urged the U.K. “to open up more low-risk countries, let vaccinated people travel without restriction, and to urgently provide a realistic date for these crucial steps for the industry to work to.”  Carriers including  Deutsche Lufthansa AG,  Air France-KLM,  American Airlines Group Inc. and  Delta Air Lines Inc. also rely on the corridor for profits. In 2019,  North Atlantic flights generated 40% more business- and first-class ticket sales than the nearest contender, according to OAG.  “The peak of the summer is already here so airlines are pretty desperate to get things moving,” said John Strickland, an aviation consultant. Global aviation capacity jumped by 3 percentage points in the past week, and stands at 65% of 2019 levels, according to Bloomberg’s weekly flight tracker, which uses OAG data to monitor the pulse of the comeback. Further improvement was seen in Germany, the biggest source of visitors within the European Union, as well as Croatia, Greece and Belgium. Each country saw capacity surge by more than 20% week-to-week. The bloc has been relaxing border restrictions between member states as well as from outside the EU, and is steadily catching up to other regions as its vaccine rollout progresses.  Airlines have increased capacity in Canada by 22% as it prepares to implement an  easing of border rules. The U.S., powered by its huge domestic market, stands at 87% of 2019 capacity, even as staffing issues slow its rebound. Pilot shortages there could potentially spread to other countries, said John Grant, chief analyst with OAG.  “The key learning for all airlines is that the recovery has been quicker than many had expected, especially in domestic markets where there are limited travel restrictions,” Grant said. “No airline can afford to enter the recovery phase and be cancelling flights,” though with load factors still soft rescheduling passengers shouldn’t be too much of an issue, he said. In the Middle East, the annual Eid holiday is expected to generate a surge in traffic, with more than  450,000 people moving through Emirates’ Dubai hub in July. The long-distance specialist said this week that it may ramp up transatlantic capacity even further, depending on changes in the feeder markets in its network.  Asia continues to be held back by zero-Covid restrictions and its lagging vaccine rollout, which has left the region vulnerable to the delta variant’s spread.  There is some movement toward targeted reopenings. In Thailand, the government is pushing ahead with plans to jumpstart its crucial tourism industry. Starting Thursday, inoculated tourists from low- and medium-risk countries such as the U.S. and Spain will be allowed to holiday on the popular resort island of Phuket without quarantining. If successful, the experiment could lead to a wider reopening of the Thai tourism industry as soon as October. At the same time, though, Australia’s strong flight recovery is under threat. Local lockdowns to counter outbreaks have hurt the domestic recovery, while the corridor with New Zealand has now been suspended.  The degree to which Europe can extend its recovery in July and August hinges on governments’ response to the delta variant, as well as their ability to coordinate on technology.  As of July 1, digital Covid certificates went live across the EU, allowing for ease of movement between member states for people who can show they’ve been fully vaccinated, recovered or tested negative for Covid-19. But each country has ultimate control of its own borders, and there has been a push led by Germany to  close ranks against the delta variant after it spread in the U.K. Over the past week, Germany imposed a quarantine on arrivals from member state Portugal, after the Iberian country was slow to introduce its own isolation rules on Britons. Malta, Spain and Italy are among the EU countries that have also tightened restrictions on British visitors. That’s stunted the U.K.’s own rebound, and helped to curtail the advantages that were expected to flow from a vaccine rollout that has now reached 67% of the population with at least one dose. For now, airlines such as  Ryanair Holdings Plc,  Wizz Air Holdings Plc and  EasyJet Plc have shifted capacity from Britain into the EU. Meanwhile, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his German counterpart Angela Merkel will on Friday discuss opening up travel, including vaccine certification coordination. An issue that caused Brits to be turned back from flights to Malta this week was resolved after the Mediterranean island country said it would recognize the U.K.’s NHS health app, which stores vaccination records. Ryanair remains hopeful, amid the reports the U.K. may loosen quarantine rules for its residents this month. It’s aiming to almost double capacity in July from June’s 5 million passengers, Chief Executive Officer Michael O’Leary said in a Bloomberg TV interview. He said bookings are strengthening as tourists from Germany, the Benelux and Scandinavia head to the beaches of Portugal, Spain, Greece and Italy.  “We expect that to continue into July and August, which should make for a reasonable recovery,” he said."
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-21/how-covid-ripped-apart-global-airlines-business,2020-12-21T21:00:20.664Z,"2020 Is Year Airlines Would Rather Forget, as These Charts Show","['Angus Whitley', 'Christopher Jasper']",Business,"A storm approaches serviced aircraft that are sealed and stored at the Asia Pacific Aircraft Storage Facility (APAS) at Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia, on Oct. 21, 2020. Few sectors of the battered global economy have been hit as hard as the airline industry in 2020. The coronavirus pandemic left fleets of planes grounded and caused air passenger traffic to slump as much as 94%. Cash-strapped carriers have been struggling to rebuild, hampered by further waves of infection and strict curbs on travel. Carriers will hemorrhage more than $118 billion this year and almost $39 billion in 2021, according to IATA. That’s way beyond the trade group’s predictions in June, when carriers retained hopes for a late summer surge in traffic, only to see them dashed by new waves of the virus. The estimated losses represent the worst two years for the industry and dwarf those racked up during the last major aviation slump in 2008. They also mark an abrupt end to a decade-long run of positive earnings, highlighting the lingering vulnerability of carriers even after years of consolidation and investment in more efficient aircraft. Meanwhile, the number of scheduled flights worldwide has remained stubbornly low since a May trough, leading traveler numbers to drop to levels last seen 17 years ago. Airlines have blamed the extended slump on government curbs such as quarantines for arriving passengers, as well as a failure to embrace airport testing, arguing that pent up demand for travel is being strangled. That theory will be put to the test as a rollout of vaccines, combined with an acceptance of testing and so-called Covid passports, may begin to open up national borders. Any real relief could be some way off, though. While European leisure airlines were earlier reporting signs of revived demand around Easter, a new strain of the virus that’s emerged in the U.K. has caused chaos ahead of the Christmas holiday, with parts of the continent and places from Canada to India and Hong Kong abruptly suspending travel links. Though the first coronavirus cases were in Asia, its impact on flights there has been neither as severe nor as protracted as in the west. The net effect has been to overturn established hierarchies and accelerate a shift toward eastern dominance of global travel. Europe, heavily exposed to international travel, has been hit especially hard, with the U.K. displaced as the third-largest market and Germany and France dropping out of the top 10. Chinese domestic traffic has proved especially resilient, rebounding to a level comparable with last year, and in turn propelling the country above the U.S. as the world’s top passenger market for the first time since the dawn of powered flight more than a century ago. John Grant, chief analyst at flight-bookings specialist OAG, predicts an American recovery next year, albeit a brief one. Asia-Pacific carriers have likewise climbed the airline rankings, though U.S. operators still occupy the three top spots, sustained by internal flights that have continued largely unabated even as the pandemic continues to rage. Western nations have also suffered a disproportionate amount of the airline sector’s 425,000 job losses. Of the 42 carriers that have failed or filed for creditor protection, 25 have been in Europe and North America. Even with a vaccine that may bring back air travel around the corner, carriers face a desperate few months. The number of airlines collapsing or entering administration is likely to reach 70 through March, according to consultant IBA Group, while IATA doesn’t expect passenger traffic to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024. From crippling financial losses and painfully diminished market values to shrunken networks and mounting debt piles, the industry has been put through the wringer. “If there ever was an annus horribilis, this is it,” International Air Transport Association Director General Alexandre de Juniac said. “Nobody in aviation will ever be nostalgic for 2020.” Here’s a selection of charts tracing Covid-19’s impact. Airline borrowings have climbed to record levels as carriers struggle to keep their heads above water. State aid to the sector has reached a gargantuan $220 billion, according to IATA. Credit ratings company Moody’s Investors Service forecasts a further $22 billion of liabilities will be added in 2021. Companies will also need to refinance some of the emergency debt accumulated, while those now saddled with government shareholders must examine whether they can repay borrowings and become masters of their own destinies again."

Europe’s largest airline group will become smaller, more efficient and use more modern planes as it manages the fallout from the pandemic that has curbed demand for travel, Spohr told reporters on Saturday at the opening of Berlin’s new airport. “We will certainly want to maintain at least our relative market strength, and maybe even use opportunities from the crisis to improve our global position,” Spohr said. Lufthansa, which owns former national carriers in Austria, Switzerland and Belgium, avoided insolvency with a 9 billion-euro ($10.5 billion) multi-government bailout, among the largest in Europe. More than two-thirds of those funds remain available to help it manage the crisis. To cut costs, Lufthansa has switched to leasing more aircraft, retiring older, fuel-guzzling jets and paring its fleet by about 150 planes to reflect lower demand, especially for lucrative business travel. It’s also trying to sell its catering business abroad, and is considering divesting a minority stake in its aircraft-maintenance arm."

Air travel to many international destinations remains lower because of restrictions, but trans-Atlantic travel should break records by next summer, United chief Scott Kirby said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “We see a huge desire for people to get back out, reunite with friends and family and connect with the world,” Kirby said. “We aren’t back to 100%, but we’re certainly headed in the right direction.” After falling by more than 95% in the spring of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic erupted, passenger loads have improved dramatically. An average of almost 2 million people a day traveled during the past week, about 76% of the equivalent period in 2019, according to Transportation Security Administration data. While United has been able to bring workers back to handle the demand, some airport businesses and the TSA’s corps of security screeners haven’t always been able to keep up, Kirby said. “There is some rust and some strains in the system,” he said. He predicted travel to Europe would rebound as soon as the U.S. lifts restrictions on flying by non-U.S. citizens, but said it would take longer for Asian routes to recover. Kirby said he has his “fingers crossed” that the requirement for airline passengers and others on public transportation to wear masks will end when the current federal rule expires on Sept. 14."

Chairman Ajay Singh, has called upon India’s government to open up the manufacture and procurement of vaccines to the private sector, saying it’s the only way to ensure the nation’s vast population receives adequate protection from the pandemic. “The government needs to become much more lenient in opening up vaccination to the private sector,” Singh said in an interview last week. “We are obviously moving at a much slower pace with vaccinations than we should be. If they let private players like labs and hospitals procure vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and let private players make Covaxin more aggressively we could significantly ramp up the administration and build up enough immunity to get out of this faster. Not allowing labs and hospitals to procure and facilitate vaccines is a huge untapped potential.” Source: SpiceJet Ltd. India is suffering the world’s worst Covid-19 outbreak and its health care system is collapsing as it runs short of everything from hospital beds to oxygen cylinders. Although the South Asian nation is one of the world’s biggest vaccine makers, supply locally has run dry amid an expansion of access to everyone aged 18 and above. To date, India’s public health care operators have done nearly all the heavy lifting in treating Covid patients. When fatigue started setting in among workers at state-run hospitals, Mumbai, one of the country’s largest and most-populated cities, invoked a colonial era law to rope in private-sector doctors. Vaccine purchases were also fully controlled by the federal government when only people aged 45 and above were eligible. “It was criminal what was going on around the country,” Singh said, adding she was getting at least 30 calls a day from people asking for beds, oxygen concentrators and tests because it was taking four days to even get a slot for testing followed by another week for results to come in and people with symptoms weren’t able to get treated without a positive report. “The general perception in the country was we’re done, Covid is gone and that was an incorrect perception to have. To a certain extent it was avoidable and to a large extent we were just not equipped for it.” SpiceHealth was founded in November last year, a time when parent company SpiceJet Ltd., India’s second-largest airline, was hard hit by the pandemic. So much red ink has prompted airlines around the world to look for new revenue streams as they burn through cash. SpiceJet began selling Covid tests for around $4 to passengers to get them back on planes. Low-cost travel pioneer AirAsia Group Bhd. has embraced a similar diversification strategy, expanding its digital operations with an app that can be used for shopping, booking flights and ordering food. SpiceHealth quickly became a first mover in cheap testing, rolling out 499 rupee ($6.90) Covid tests -- one-fifth the then market rate in Delhi. That price is now largely the industry standard. SpiceHealth was also the first to set up mobile labs that can be quickly erected and moved as need be. There are now 15 SpiceHealth mobile labs across five states and each can process as many as 3,000 samples a day. “We got a lot of backlash from private players when we came up with 499 rupee tests,” Singh said. “It’s really about breaking that chain of pricing far above cost and you can recover a lot of that margin with scale. The mobile testing lab model is disruptive and very effective. There are underserved areas around the country where it’s very difficult to ramp up a fixed facility, find manpower and sustain it over a long period of time. With a mobile lab we can provide instant numbers and cover clusters where the need is the highest.” Singh said SpiceHealth, which is profitable and debt-free, would like to offer an end-to-end solution from procurement to transportation and administration of shots and reach remote areas but procuring vaccines as a private company has been a challenge. “The biggest bottleneck with vaccines is the procurement, getting hold of companies that will sell directly to the private sector. That’s the challenge most companies that are trying to get involved are facing,” she said."

Vietnam’s seat capacity surged 50% over the prior week, though the usually popular tourist destination remains below pre-pandemic levels and closed to international travelers, according to Bloomberg’s weekly flight tracker, which uses OAG data to monitor the pulse of the industry’s comeback. Globally, aviation capacity improved by almost 1 percentage point and now stands at 62% of 2019 levels, the data show. The positive signs are starting to feed through to airlines even beyond the U.S., where  pilot shortages have suddenly appeared. Qatar Airways said this week that it has seen an uptick in bookings, while  Emirates,  Air France-KLM and  Wizz Air Holdings Plc plan to  ramp up capacity over the summer to meet pent-up travel demand to sunny destinations."

IATA, which represents about 290 airlines globally, is working with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the World Health Organization to put in place scalable, affordable and fast testing systems, said Conrad Clifford, IATA’s regional vice president for Asia Pacific. “We need testing because we need to get rid of quarantines,” Clifford said in an interview on Bloomberg Television Monday. “What we’ve seen so far is if there’s a 14-day quarantine, it’s the same as closing your borders.” Clifford said IATA would “prefer to see some testing before departure and ideally, if we can find countries with similar levels of Covid risk, much like Singapore and Hong Kong, then that takes away the need for further testing.” Singapore and Hong Kong agreed last week to open their borders to one another for the first time in almost seven months, exempting people in both cities from compulsory quarantine to help reinstate links between Asia’s two premier financial hubs. Details on the arrangement, which is expected to start within weeks, haven’t yet been publicly laid out. Tests should ideally cost less than $10, Clifford said. The risk of passengers getting infected is “very low” as airlines are carrying out deeper sanitizing of planes, and cut back on in-flight catering and magazines, Clifford said. Based on about 44 potential cases of infection on board recorded this year, the chances of passengers getting the virus is about one in 27 million, he said. The chance of being infected on board is lower than that of being struck by a lightning, Clifford said. “There have been a lot measures airlines have taken to absolutely drive that chance down to as close to zero as we can get it. So it’s a very safe environment indeed.” While IATA forecast in June that airlines will lose a combined $84 billion this year because of the virus, that number is set to be larger because the market hasn’t opened as the industry had hoped, Clifford said. The group has said that it expects travel demand won’t recover to the pre-Covid levels until 2024. Cargo has been “a little bit of a silver lining” for the industry -- partly fueled by online purchasing -- and that is set to continue for the coming years, Clifford said. Airfreight is expected to account for about 26% of carriers’ revenue this year, compared with 12% in 2019, he said. Cargo rates jumped after thousands of passenger planes, which carry more than half of airfreight, were grounded due to the travel restrictions. That prompted airlines to convert passenger planes to haul goods."

Air Canada declined 2.6% to C$26.29 as of 12:39 p.m. in Toronto. Earlier it dropped more than 6.6% as the market absorbed the news that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government is buying C$500 million of shares at a discount. The government will also receive warrants as part of a financing agreement that makes Air Canada eligible for five new credit facilities, according to a company statement. The dilution for shareholders “was greater than we had anticipated,” Kevin Chiang, an analyst at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a note. If all the warrants were exercised, the government would own 9.7%, Chiang said. In return for the money, Air Canada agreed to restrict share buybacks and dividends, keep employment at April 1 levels and follow through on a deal to buy 33 Airbus SE A220s made at a factory in Quebec. Executives won’t be allowed to earn more than C$1 million. And the airline will resume service on routes its suspended to distant locations such as Gander, Newfoundland and Yellowknife, in the country’s far north. The long-anticipated announcement will ease tensions between the industry and Trudeau’s government, which since last March has barred most foreign travelers from entering the country and recently made the rules even tougher. Air Canada repeatedly complained that its home country was the only Group of Seven member without an aid plan specifically for the aviation sector -- although the company has used federal wage subsidies available to all industries hit by the pandemic. “We wanted a good deal, not just any deal. And getting a good deal can sometimes take a little time,” Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said at a news conference Monday evening. Air Canada also committed to paying back customers who didn’t take flights they had booked because of Covid-19. One of the credit facilities, a C$1.4 billion line, is dedicated to financing refunds. “At first glance, the Canadian government’s aid package to Air Canada looks somewhat onerous,” Citigroup analysts said in a note. “On one hand, the aid certainly helps provide a more stable financial situation for the carrier. On the other, some of the requirements seem difficult.” While the equity component is “somewhat surprising,” the package is “the money that’s needed,” said Robert Kokonis, managing director of Toronto-based aviation consulting firm AirTrav Inc. “It’s going to take a lot of aid for carriers. We’ve been through a lot. We’ve been on standby while airlines in countries around the world have received one or more aid packages,” Kokonis said. Freeland said talks are ongoing with other airlines, including WestJet Airlines Ltd., controlled by Toronto-based investment firm Onex Corp. Tour operator Transat AT Inc. also needs money and has said it’s talking to the government after a deal to be taken over by Air Canada fell apart. “Wherever and whenever the federal government provides public aid, the supported company will have to give solid guarantees, as Air Canada did, that the public interest will be respected, workers protected, and travelers’ interest defended,” Freeland said. Travel into Canadian airports like Pearson in Toronto, shown in February, has been heavily restricted since the pandemic began last year. As of March 18, government financing for the airline industry globally -- including loans and equity stakes in exchange for cash -- has totaled more than $183 billion, according to Ishka Ltd., an aviation finance and investment consultancy. Before Monday’s agreement, Canada’s most visible lifeline to the industry was a combined C$375 million in emergency loans to Sunwing Airlines Inc. and Sunwing Vacations Inc., a small vacation operator. Air Canada said it will only draw down the new credit facilities “as required”. The package includes C$2.48 billion in unsecured loans. “This program provides additional liquidity, if required, to rebuild our business to the benefit of all stakeholders and to remain a significant contributor to the Canadian economy through its recovery and for the long term,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Rousseau said in a statement."

The airline will cancel 950 flights during the first 13 days of July, after it scrapped about 775 flights over the weekend and into Monday on what it cited as poor weather conditions at its Miami and Chicago hubs that exacerbated a shortfall in pilots. In some cases, delays caused by storms exhausted its group of reserve pilots. The sudden jump in demand fueled by people tired of staying close to home has strained airlines’ ability to rebuild operations cut back amid the onset of the pandemic last year. Pilots who took leave and those who were switched to new types of planes have had to be retrained as flight demand has recovered to near-2019 levels. American added flights back faster than its primary competitors and is operating at about 10% below its 2019 seat capacity, according to records from flight-data firm OAG. Delta Air Lines Inc. is more than 20% behind pre-pandemic capacity and United Airlines Holdings Inc. is more than 30% below. American didn’t immediately comment on the difference. American and other airlines have had trouble matching their desire to offer flights with their ability to assemble crews, although it expects to complete training for furloughed pilots by the end of June. The airline said it dropped flights in markets that have other options for passengers and is working to make schedule changes in advance of travelers’ departure dates. American rose less than 1% to $22.45 in New York trading, the smallest gain on a Standard & Poor’s index of the five largest U.S. carriers, which advanced 1.7%. Southwest Airlines Co. canceled about 200 flights Monday and at least 30 more on Tuesday ahead of summer storms that were expected to push across much of the U.S. South and Northeast, including New York, Washington and Philadelphia, a spokesman said. About 823 Southwest flights, or 23%, were delayed Monday and 24% at American, according to tracker FlightAware.com. American’s flight cancellations grew by about 300 Monday, in part because of storm activity at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, its biggest hub. U.S. carriers have struggled to match the supply of aircraft and crews with soaring demand for air travel. The seven-day average number of passengers exceeded 1.9 million for the first time since the pandemic, according to Transportation Security Administration tallies of people going though security at U.S. airports. While raw passenger counts have been climbing steadily as infections and deaths fall, the trend coincides with the traditional increase as the summer travel season approaches. As a result, the number of people flying has remained at about 73% of 2019 levels, including for all of June. “We’re just seeing a rocket ship straight up to where we were prior to the pandemic domestically,” said Dennis Tajer, an American captain and spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association. About 1,000 American pilots retired early or left the airline voluntarily during the pandemic as U.S. carriers sought to reduce headcount to match gutted demand. American’s scheduling system, which has long been a sore point between the carrier and its pilots union, hasn’t kept up with the expanded schedule, he said. “We’re disappointed that management is surrendering to reducing the schedule rather than working with APA to create solutions to fly the schedule.” Aviators who have been concerned about American’s viability have encouraged the airline to “be aggressive” with allowing willing pilots to pick up overtime flying, Tajer said. The airline didn’t immediately comment on the union’s claim."

The decision moves the regional carrier squarely onto larger rival Air Canada’s home turf as the airline industry prepares for a surge in travel demand as pandemic restrictions begin to ease. The introduction of jets also marks a shift for Porter, which has previously relied on a turboprop fleet. “We believe that now is the right time to make this investment as the pandemic resets the aviation landscape,” Porter Chief Executive Michael Deluce said in a statement. “Adding a diverse selection of popular business and leisure destinations to our network means that we are better positioned to serve the needs of many more passengers.” The airline has ordered 30 Embraer jets, with purchase rights for a further 50. The deal is valued at $5.82 billion, if all 80 are ordered, and will be funded from aircraft sale-leaseback agreements and privately from shareholders. The planes are expected to enter into service starting in the latter half of 2022. Canadian airlines are hoping to capitalize on pent-up demand from travelers after more than a year of lockdowns and travel restrictions that resulted in flight suspensions and sweeping cost cuts. Porter flights have been suspended since March 2020. This will be the first time Porter has operated service out of Pearson, Canada’s largest airport. The carrier launched in 2006 offering commuter flights from Billy Bishop Airport, located on an island in Toronto’s harbor. Porter said it will continue to offer downtown departures with service expected to resume Sept. 8. “Our commitment to Billy Bishop Airport is not changing,” said Robert Deluce, Porter’s founder and executive chairman. “Our corporate headquarters at Billy Bishop is being maintained and we will continue serving the same network of regional markets from downtown Toronto. ” Potential destinations for the E2s, which have transcontinental range and can carry 120 to 146 passengers, include Mexico, the Caribbean, and dozens of North American cities, the airline said. In addition to Toronto’s Pearson, the new jets will fly out of Montreal, Ottawa and Halifax. The investment will create as many as 6,000 new jobs, the airline said. “We don’t have concerns longer term -- we think we’re near the tail end of what has been a very difficult 15 months,” Michael Deluce said in an interview with BNN Bloomberg Television. “We’re well situated to handle the period really, post-pandemic.”"

The tender offer is for three bonds issued between April and September 2020, according to a news release. The airline raised cash to survive the crisis as travel collapsed worldwide amid lockdowns to try to contain the Covid-19 outbreak. The notes are: The offer, which investors can choose to accept or not, shows that the airline is beginning to chip away at its balance sheet that has seen debt swell over the last year. Delta’s adjusted net debt was $18.3 billion through the June quarter, or $7.8 billion higher than December 2019, it said in a report earlier this week. The company finally reversed a cash burn and generated $1.5 billion of cash in the latest quarter. “With improving financial performance and a strong liquidity position, we’re using cash to reduce leverage and non-operating expense while rebuilding unencumbered assets and managing our debt maturity profile,” said interim-Chief Financial Officer Gary Chase in an earnings call on Wednesday. The 4.5% bonds included in Delta’s offer were part of a $9 billion deal, the industry’s largest debt sale at the time, secured by the company’s frequent-flier program and issued at a time when the airline was burning through $27 million a day. That followed United Airlines Holdings Inc., which issued the first-ever airline miles deal in July 2020. Delta lost its investment-grade rating in 2020 due to the pandemic and is working to regain it. The company is rated BB by S&P Global Ratings, two steps into junk, and BB+ by Fitch Ratings, one step into junk. Only Moody’s Investors Service still rates the company in the lowest rung of investment grade at Baa3.

So He Started Over,['Chris Stokel-Walker'],Reinvention,"Many entrepreneurs in the travel industry saw their business disappear from Covid-19. With normality years away, many are looking to other options. Running a travel business in 2020 is difficult enough, but Jonathan Baylis’s firm faced a triple whammy when the coronavirus struck. The 33-year-old’s company provided package tours for religious devotees, 70 percent of which went to the Catholic pilgrimage site of Medjugorje in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the Virgin Mary purportedly appeared in the 1980s. Enjoying Bloomberg Wealth? To read more articles based on your personal financial goals, answer these 3 questions that will tailor your reading experience. The country “had never been in the travel corridor list and most of our clients were in the vulnerable category, the over-65s,” says Baylis, based in Box, England. “It made it impossible to go this year. It’s not like we were going to the Canary Islands and could get a month in here and there.” But Baylis had a 2-year-old daughter, and another, a son, born during the pandemic in June, to support. Seven-year-old Aglow Pilgrimages wasn’t making any money. The 100 bookings a month he saw in the first two months of the year disappeared when the pandemic took hold. “It was basically a situation of hoping travel would come back as soon as possible, and rescheduling bookings for autumn thinking it’ll have blown over by then,” he explains. But in the back of his mind he considered the unpalatable alternative: travel wouldn’t bounce back as speedily as that.  Baylis is a tiny part of a massive global industry crippled by the pandemic. The airline industry is forecast to carry 1.8 billion passengers in 2020, according to the International Air Traffic Association—a total last seen in 2003, and down about 60 percent from 2019. Airlines have lost more than $400 billion in passenger revenue year on year. And passenger numbers for 2021 are only forecast to be 2.8 billion, down 1.7 billion from pre-pandemic times. Travel won’t return to 2019 levels until 2024 at the earliest, IATA says. “We just saw bookings fall off a cliff,” says Baylis, who decided to set up a backup business, supplying bulk firewood to people in the U.K., called LogsNearMe.co.uk. “It’s a growing market and would be covid-proof,” he says. “If we had a lockdown in winter, people are going to be spending more time at home, working from home, burning more logs.” When the U.K. lockdown lifted earlier this year, Baylis was one of the 1.8 billion passengers to take a plane—to Lithuania, where he met with suppliers of firewood and brokered business deals. Cautiously following his business plan, he ordered two containers of wood initially, not wanting to spend on stock sat in expensive warehouses. When LogsNearMe.co.uk launched its website in September, customers bought out the stock within a month. “We’ve been playing a waiting game, waiting for more containers to arrive,” says Baylis. Baylis has since ordered six 45-foot containers, and made £10,000 ($13,200) of sales of firewood in the first week of December—its biggest week in a short existence. The founder’s hunch that firewood was a covid-proof business has proved correct so far. “As quickly as it comes in, it goes,” he explains. The website now shows no stock available. Aglow Pilgrimages has been mothballed for now. “I hope to resurrect it as soon as things return to normality and travel starts again, but I wouldn’t be surprised if this overtakes Aglow in a few years,” says Baylis. The log business hasn’t all been easy. Baylis’s post-lockdown sojourn in eastern Europe saw him encounter a few rogue traders, one of whom he entered into a supply deal with. That shipment hasn’t yet arrived in the U.K., and Baylis is uncertain whether it ever will. Still, Baylis feels lucky to have come out of the pandemic with a new business that’s a going concern.

West Texas Intermediate futures surpassed the $70 mark to close at its highest since Oct. 2018 after briefly touching the key psychological level earlier this week. U.S. oil supplies fell 2.11 million barrels last week, the American Petroleum Institute was said to report. That would be the third straight weekly decline if confirmed by U.S. government data on Wednesday. At the same time, confidence in the outlook for oil demand continues to grow as accelerating vaccinations allow people to travel more. The Middle Eastern Dubai benchmark is trading in its steepest backwardation -- a market structure that indicates supply tightness -- in almost a year after the region’s physical market had a strong start to the month. “There’s all sorts of technical models that work off closing prices,” said Bill O’Grady, executive vice president at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis. “Any time you have a close above a number divisible by 5, it tends to be pretty significant” in attracting flows such as those from commodity trading advisors. Prices retreated from session highs after settlement, with the API report also showing sizable weekly increases in both gasoline and distillate inventories. Still, the path toward normal travel behaviors in the world’s largest oil-consuming country has provided support to the market as it takes on new multi-year highs. The U.S. State Department eased its travel warnings for nations around the world, including France, Canada and Germany, which could pave the way for loosening airline restrictions for trips overseas. “The fundamental outlook for crude is bullish right now,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. “The easing of travel restrictions will be a game-changer for the international air travel outlook, which is the last part of the equation for a robust demand recovery.” WTI posted its narrowest discount against Brent since November following a similar run up last month. With the narrowness in the spread persisting, U.S. exports may see a dip as WTI loses competitiveness. Meanwhile, American shale oil production is poised to rise only moderately through 2022, even though gains in crude prices have triggered a pickup in drilling, according to BloombergNEF. That comes as the Energy Information Administration trimmed its shale output forecasts for next year, according to a monthly report. WTI for July delivery was trading at $70.06 a barrel as of 4:44 p.m. after settling at $70.05 a barrel in New York Brent for August settlement rose 73 cents to end the session at $72.22 a barrel KKR & Co. is building a shale-oil acquisition vehicle with the $5.7 billion combination of two little-known explorers.

Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA and Azul SA -- which together had about three-fourths of the Brazilian domestic market share in July, according to Citigroup Inc. -- are seeing demand rebound more quickly than forecast, although it remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Investors are increasingly confident the low-cost carriers can survive a travel downturn that has forced three of the region’s largest airlines into bankruptcy. “The outlook is brighter as the recovery on domestic demand in Brazil has been faster than expected and the fact that Azul and Gol are focused on the local market,” said Josseline Jenssen, a credit analyst at Lucror Analytics. “Cash flow generation should improve with higher sales.” Bonds sold by Gol and Azul have returned 70% and 45%, respectively, since the end of March, compared to -6.5% for the Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Airlines Index. Shares in the companies, meanwhile, are up 53% and 31%, respectively, outperforming the Bloomberg World Airlines Index. Year to date, both stocks are still down at least 50%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gol this week said it operated an average of 270 flights per day in September, up from around 40 flights per day in April. Azul said it expects to operate at roughly 55% of pre-Covid capacity in October, putting it ahead of its original guidance that it would be at 40% by the end of the year. “Once again we continue to see an improvement in domestic passenger demand as we approach the strongest travel season in Brazil,” Azul’s Chief Executive Officer John Rodgerson said in a statement. Across Latin America, flights are slowly coming back after governments lifted travel bans aimed at containing the spread of the new coronavirus. At the height of the downturn, Chile’s Latam Airlines Group SA, Bogota-based Avianca Holdings SA and Grupo Aeromexico SAB declared bankruptcy in the U.S. as bans and a lack of demand forced them to ground planes. Carriers in the region quadrupled capacity in September, compared to May, according to data compiled by OAG Aviation. Azul’s liquidity of 2.3 billion reais (about $410 million) at the end of September gives a cash cushion of more than 30 months. Azul ended August with about 2.1 billion reais. The airlines are also weighing tapping capital markets to raise additional cash with support of a the Brazilian development bank, BNDES. The improving outlook prompted analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Raymond James, and Deutsche Bank AG to upgrade the carriers’ stock recently to buy. The airlines can “not only survive, but thrive” in what’s poised to be a low-fare environment for a while, Deutsche Bank analysts wrote last month."

That lapse appears to have been how he became infected with Covid-19. The case, cited in a recently published study of an outbreak among passengers on a January flight, is one of the first to document a probable transmission on an airliner and is reviving calls for government rules requiring masks. It comes as safety concerns raise questions about whether passengers will return in sufficient numbers to keep airline companies from collapsing. Lawmakers and airline unions -- which have sought more rigorous standards for months as infections surge across the nation and reports circulate of passengers skirting existing rules -- said the study adds new weight to their demands. “This report seems to confirm the tragic consequences of the Trump administration’s abject failure to protect passengers by mandating masks,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat. “Wearing masks, like requiring seat belts or banning smoking, is absolutely fundamental to protecting passengers and crew during these unprecedented times.” The head of a union representing flight attendants -- the workers most exposed to passengers and who are called on to enforce airline mask directives -- called the lack of action “inexcusable.” “This new study underscores the urgent need for a single national policy that would mandate that masks be worn, and worn properly, on all commercial flights,” said Julie Hedrick, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants at American Airlines Group Inc. All major U.S. airlines now require passengers to cover their faces, but advocates for a federal mask requirement say it would make enforcement easier, potentially making violations a crime. It would also set a more uniform standard, they say. The Department of Transportation earlier this month released a 44-page set of guidelines for airlines and airports that urges mask usage, but officials have repeatedly said they don’t favor legal requirements. The airline industry is facing a crisis as passenger counts, which plummeted to about 5% of pre-pandemic levels in April, started coming back but stalled in recent weeks at about 25%, according to Transportation Security Administration data. Companies have warned of possibly tens of thousands of layoffs once restrictions tied to initial federal aid expire on Sept. 30. President Donald Trump has rarely worn a mask and some of his allies bitterly oppose mandatory orders for them, though he declared his support for face coverings in briefings last week. “The Department of Transportation and FAA have been clear that passengers should wear face coverings while traveling by air, for their own protection and the protection of those around them,” the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. The trade group for large carriers, Airlines for America, said: “U.S. airlines are continuing to take extraordinary measures as part of a multilayered approach to help protect the health and well-being of the traveling public and employees.” Air travel presents unique risks for contracting the virus because conditions are so crowded. Research has shown airborne diseases such as Covid-19 can be transmitted on planes, but risks aren’t well quantified. The Jan. 24 flight from Singapore to Hangzhou, China is the most thoroughly documented case of a likely passenger-to-passenger infection of Covid-19 to date. About 100 of the 335 passengers had recently traveled to Wuhan, China, where the disease erupted originally, and a handful exhibited symptoms. As a result, everyone was quarantined for at least two weeks. They were questioned in detail by infectious disease experts. The peer-reviewed results of the study were published online July 6 by the journal Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease. The team in China concluded that one man most likely became infected by fellow passengers after ruling out other possible contacts and noting the timing of when he became ill. For an hour of the flight, he went to talk with his wife and son, who were in a different row. “While he talked, he reported that he did not wear his mask tightly, and his nose was outside of mask,” the authors wrote. Two people adjacent to him in the same row and two more across the aisle in the row directly behind tested positive for Covid-19, including one was already showing symptoms, the study found. Ashok Srinivasan, a computer science professor at the University of West Florida who specializes in modeling disease transmission and has studied airline travel, said the paper highlights the importance of masks in preventing the spread of the coronavirus in crowded environments. “I think it is important to wear the mask all the time,” Srinivasan said. The study’s authors said the 15 other passengers who got Covid-19 were infected while in Wuhan or by close contacts with family members or others. The aircraft, a Boeing Co. 787-9, is equipped with filters that remove the virus from recirculated air and that may have lowered the chances that others became infected, the authors said. All modern jetliners have such filters. The study acknowledged the researchers couldn’t completely rule out whether the man had been infected elsewhere, but said the evidence suggests “he probably acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection during the flight.”. The leaders of two House committees overseeing transportation policy have inserted language requiring the government to adopt strict mask standards into separate bills. The bills have yet to be taken up by the Senate. Representative Peter DeFazio, the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, called the study “intriguing,” but said enough doubt remains that the FAA should conduct its own research. “That’s why I’ve repeatedly pressed the FAA to not only commission its own study to better understand how the virus travels within the airplane cabin, but also to mandate masks,” DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat, said in a statement. Representative David Price, the North Carolina Democrat who heads the Appropriations Committee panel overseeing transportation spending, said in an interview that a federally mandated mask rule is needed to set “an example for the entire country.” How Safe Is Flying in the Age of Coronavirus?: QuickTake U.S. Airlines Vow Refunds for People Turned Away for Fever American ‘Reached Out’ to Cruz About Not Wearing Mask on Flight Virus Can Travel 26 Feet at Cold Meat Plants With Stale Air"

Europe’s fury was triggered after an airliner traveling from Athens to Vilnius was diverted last month under the escort of a Mig-29 fighter jet to the Belarusian capital. Police there arrested Raman Pratasevich, who had reported on the protests against President Alexander Lukashenko’s discredited declaration of victory in last year’s election. As an initial step, EU diplomats are expected to sign off Friday on banning Belarusian carriers from flying over European airspace, as well as landing and taking off from the bloc’s airports, two of the people told Bloomberg. If approved, the measures would come into force as early as midnight that same evening, one of them said. Early next week the EU will discuss proposals to sanction at least seven individuals and one entity, said two diplomats. The list currently under discussion includes ministers, persons in the Belarusian Air Force and other aviation-related people and entities, according to one of the diplomats. The proposed list has yet to be approved, said another diplomat. All three diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the issue. Read More: U.S. Announces Sanctions on Belarus Over Journalist’s Detention The EU has already sanctioned seven Belarusian entities and 88 individuals, including the nation’s disputed Lukashenko. The bloc was already working on adding more people to that list over their support for his government and its crackdown on protests against his declaration of victory in last year’s elections. These new additions would be on top of those plans. Meanwhile, technical work continues on further measures, following an agreement in May between EU leaders to adopt “targeted economic sanctions.” The exact sectors to be affected have yet to be defined but are likely to include areas, such as potash, where state enterprises are most active, an EU official told Bloomberg last month. The official said the aim was to have the economic sanctions ready by summer. Potash, a soil nutrient used to improve crops, is Belarus’s major export -- also supplying a large share of European demand -- and the country’s only abundant mineral resource. The timing of the measures will depend on the EU’s 27 governments ability to agree and will need to name specific sectors and be clearly defined to withstand potential legal proceedings and win the backing of all member states. Peter Stano, the EU’s lead spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy, told Bloomberg in an email: “We do not comment on the ongoing procedures and discussions among the member states in the Council, these procedures are supposed to be confidential.” Stano added that work relating to Belarus “was well underway with the aim to approve all the restrictive measures as soon as possible”."

Delta Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian has spent much of 2021’s first quarter talking about the  “year of recovery” to come. Buoyed by the hope that vaccinations will restore consumer confidence in aviation and give fuel to the fire of pent-up demand, he is preparing to turn a profit by midyear—something that’s sorely needed after record losses of $12.39 billion in 2020. The company saw improvement at the end of last year: It slashed its cash drain in half from the third to fourth quarter, and fourth-quarter net losses of $755 million paled in comparison to those of American and United—both around $2 billion. But Delta and its competitors still expect a bumpy road ahead. “It’s always darkest before the dawn, and that’s exactly where we are,” says Bastian. He expects the U.S. to reach some initial stage of herd immunity in the early summer, barring the emergence of vaccine-resistant mutations of Covid-19. “That will be the key to getting travel going—though it will just be one stage, one meaningful step, as we build back to a new normal.” The same milestone, he says, may be the trigger that allows Delta to reopen bookings for middle seats, which it has blocked for social distancing throughout the pandemic. Another meaningful step, he says, will be the  reopening of international borders. “Specifically in Asia, they will be very conservative [about this],” says Bastian. “But in 12 to 18 months, I believe international travel will be back.” That’s a while to wait. But the upside, he explains, is that travelers will return to find the aviation industry improved in many ways. The pandemic and the events of 2020 have led companies and their leaders to reinvent themselves with an eye toward sustainability, resiliency, and inclusivity—inspiring industry-wide improvements that will far outlast Covid-19. Last February, Delta made a commitment to spend $1 billion on greening its operations over the next decade, with the goal of becoming the world’s first carbon-neutral airline through the use of alternative fuels, carbon offsets, and improved recycling and waste-reduction efforts. “We have to set the stage for the next generations that will follow me and follow us,” says Bastian, framing sustainability efforts as both moral and economic imperatives. “You can’t have a business opportunity and platform for growth if the world does not see your product and service contributing to society.” Certainly, it would be easier for many to accept the socioeconomic benefits of the  $1.7 trillion travel industry if massive quantities of jet fuels were not required. “We know, within our industry, the footprint we create is somewhere around 2% to 3% of the world’s carbon footprint,” says Bastian. “Left unattended, that number will double in the next 10 to 20 years—so the more that join us on this mission, the better.” Counterintuitively, sustainability is also a lynchpin to  restoring business travel after the pandemic. With ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) investments taking a more important role than ever, many companies that use Delta for business travel needs are reevaluating their carbon footprints—particularly in the tech sector. “We don’t want them to get to net zero by eliminating air travel,” explains Bastian, “so we have to ensure that the work that Delta is doing to save its own footprint can relate to [their] strategies.” The same can be said about the company’s diversity and inclusivity efforts, which have been a personal focus for Bastian since the 2020 protests surrounding George Floyd’s death. Delta committed to doubling Black leadership roles within the company by 2025, doubling its spending with Black-owned businesses, and overhauling its talent acquisition strategies to create a better pipeline for Black professional development. (The company is also tracking its progress on those goals in a public way, for accountability.)   Like the greening plays, these inclusivity goals are also good for Delta’s bottom line. “We will best serve our customers and connect the world if we reflect the world,” Bastian says. “We’re stronger when we have more points of view expressed around the table, and we can better anticipate our customers’ needs—better relate to them when they get onboard our planes—if they are being served by people that look like them.” In an environment in which traditional loyalty—the points and miles kind—has been  increasingly devalued, these efforts may also serve as an important way to attract and retain customers. “The younger generations of today are demanding this,” explains Bastian. “Consumers are demanding it in increasing numbers and giving their loyalty to companies that reflect their own values.” Waiting for government to fix the big problems of our day is not an option either, says Bastian, especially as many are so politically fractured. With such topics as sustainability and diversity wielding global impact, it’s important that global companies shoulder some responsibility in designing solutions. “We all have our roles to play. In as divided a time as I can ever recall, we can’t leave it all to government. The business world has to step up and be accountable,” he says.  That focus on sustainability and diversity has earned Bastian plenty of praise, as well as critics who say he’s become too political. But Bastian believes that 2020 rewrote the rulebook for a lot of things, including how to be a good leader. “As a corporate CEO, you’re trained to stay out of the firing line of any topic that generally is not specific to your exact business mission and purpose,” he says. “But that’s maybe more broadly defined than ever these days—and I think our customers, our society, and our leaders throughout the world have a voice when they see inequity. Or else, silence speaks as well.” Delta’s commitment to blocking middle seats during the pandemic has been a public relations triumph for the company—one that is currently slated to last through April. Pressed as to whether that expiration date would stick, Bastian concedes that the popular policy is likely to be extended until summer. “We know it’s safe to sit there,” says Bastian, “but we’re going to follow the confidence and comfort of our customers. When we see demand for those middle seats start to pick up, that’ll be the signal to us to start selling them.” While Bastian is bearish on international travel in 2021, he feels strongly that domestic air travel will make a strong return this summer, in step with the U.S. vaccination program. If that prediction pans out, so will his current plan to start booking middle seats at the same time. What won’t change are all the new protocols put into place around cleanliness and safety. Antimicrobial bins at TSA, mask-wearing rules, and state-of-the-art air filtration systems are here to stay.   Bastian also sees a new version of business travel supplanting the traditional two-meetings, in-and-out, road warrior style of years past. It’s one in which a new generation of digital nomads will benefit from cultural exchange wherever they can connect to the internet. “People will travel because they can remotely work, and companies will find it helps with retention and costs,” he says. This version of business travel, says Bastian, “will be similar in scale from what we know, but the purpose and form will be different.” That, along with a continued emphasis on private space for leisure travelers, will keep demand strong for seats at the front of the plane, he expects, resulting in a more resilient business model that’s not as strongly dependent on steady business from large corporations. The bottom line, says Bastian, is that once the pandemic ends, “the real value for travel will be clear—and people will place a higher premium on that.”"

Etihad hasn’t set a delivery date for Boeing Co.’s coming 777X, and it’s not clear if the Airbus SE A380 superjumbo will ever return or how many A350s are needed, Chief Executive Officer Tony Douglas said in an interview Wednesday. He said the focus will instead be on the smaller Boeing 787 Dreamliner. “The point really is to concentrate on the backbone, and the backbone for us is the 787,” Douglas said on Bloomberg Television. The CEO’s comments underscore how far the pandemic is threatening to transform travel as airlines shift focus to shorter routes where demand is expected to recover faster, potentially at the expense of the globe-spanning super-hub model long championed by the three biggest Mideast carriers. Etihad once sought to go toe-to-toe in linking every corner of the planet with Qatar Airways Ltd. and Dubai-based Emirates, whose president, Tim Clark said Wednesday he expects hubs to survive. Yet even before the health crisis, Etihad had made some of the deepest fleet cuts in the industry as it tried to rein in losses and refocus the network on the needs of Abu Dhabi, the airline’s owner. Douglas didn’t go into specifics on longer-term plans for the order book. He said he doesn’t expect air travel to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023, adding that he didn’t want to create “false certainty” in terms of a rebound. Etihad has a fleet of 40 Dreamliners and potentially 11 more still to come after already trimming its order by 20 aircraft in 2019. Alongside the 787s it’s currently looking to deploy no more than 12 Airbus A350s, Douglas said. The company has an order for 20 of the planes, down from 62 originally, of which five have been delivered and are standing idle. Of Etihad’s 10 A380s, the CEO said he’s “not sure we’ll ever bring them back,” with the double-deckers having a role only on the busiest routes to cities such as London and New York even in the event of a strong rebound. An exit would mean an end to the Residence, an opulent suite layout introduced in 2014 that came with a dedicated butler. Etihad has six remaining orders for Boeing’s 777-9 after already scaling down its commitment from 25. The model is now slated to debut in 2023 after numerous delays. Douglas said there’s no fixed date to take deliveries. Etihad has become the first carrier to fully inoculate its crew, Douglas said, adding that he expects potential passengers who have had the jab to have “right of passage.” At Emirates, hit particularly hard during the slump because of its all-A380 and 777 fleet, Clark was upbeat about prospects for a rebound, saying the number of destinations served could actually grow by 30%, mainly by tapping smaller markets through sister airline Flydubai. “There was never any suggestion that the super-hub that we created would alter in any way,” he said at a webinar hosted by CAPA-Centre for Aviation."

Jordan hadn’t authorized the flight path of Netanyahu’s plane over its territory in time, the Israeli leader’s office said in a statement Thursday. Amman apparently was piqued that its crown prince’s proposed trip to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem was scrapped a day earlier after a dispute over security arrangements, it said. Netanyahu’s visit, which he could have used to try to burnish his image as a statesman ahead of Israel’s March 23 election, had already been rescheduled several times. Early reports on Thursday put the latest delay down to Netanyahu’s wife being hospitalized. Jordan eventually authorized the flight, but too late for the trip to go ahead, Netanyahu’s office said, adding it would take place later. Despite the cancellation, the two countries started talks to establish a quarantine-free travel corridor and are looking at developing anti-drone equipment, statements from UAE state news agency WAM said, showing bilateral ties are stretching into the sensitive defense sector. The UAE became the third Arab country to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel last year, in a deal that was backed by the then-Trump administration. The two sides share a desire to combat Iran’s influence in the region, and have promised cooperation on investments and technology. The two Middle Eastern nations, which have the world’s fastest inoculation programs against Covid-19, aim to implement the travel agreement for people fully vaccinated in April, according to WAM. The corridor will facilitate travel for commercial, tourism and official purposes, and might provide a model for countries looking to vaccines as a way to open up air travel all but grounded since the virus started to spread last year. Separately Abu Dhabi-owned defense firm EDGE said it had entered into a pact with state-run Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. to jointly develop an advanced system to counter drone aircraft using advanced 3D radar and communications intelligence. Since signing their peace pact, Israel and the UAE have started direct flights and discussed business deals, and are discussing an oil pipeline linking the Red Sea with the Mediterranean."

Futures in New York advanced 1.4% on Monday to the highest since April 2019. The U.S. and China, along with parts of Europe, are rapidly recovering from the pandemic as vaccinations increase, overshadowing concerns around weaker consumption  in India. In the U.S., the number of passengers at airports jumped to the highest since the pandemic began, a sign of the domestic travel revival that’s leading the way in a jet fuel demand rebound.  For the U.S., “the consensus is building around a very strong summer demand period,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC. “The supply and demand balance is going to be a little short as we get deeper into the year,” supporting prices. Oil’s rally of more than 4% this month comes as even the hardest-hit parts of the oil market -- namely, jet fuel -- are showing signs of a revival. The number of people passing through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints at U.S. airports surged to 1.85 million on Sunday -- the highest since March 2020 -- pointing to the recovery in domestic U.S. air travel that’s seen underpinning a summer surge in jet fuel demand. United Airlines Holdings Inc. on Monday said it plans to operate 80% of its pre-pandemic U.S. schedule. The U.S. Travel Rebound Is Leading Jet Fuel’s Summer Surge “More reopenings in Europe, consumer confidence and travel normalizing” are all boosting confidence in a demand rebound, said Phil Streible, chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures LLC in Chicago. In the U.S., “more and more people are getting vaccinated and those people are now traveling.” The recovery underway in the U.S. is helping offset a tepid recovery in Asia, where the coronavirus is crippling key importer India and Singapore and Taiwan are grappling with new outbreaks. Another wildcard is the prospect of more crude flows from Iran as the nation seeks to revive a nuclear deal and free itself of U.S. sanctions. Talks are ongoing, however, and progress on a solution remains uncertain. West Texas Intermediate for June delivery rose 90 cents to settle at $66.27 a barrel Brent for July settlement gained 75 cents to end the session at $69.46 a barrel, the highest since March 11 BP Plc is in advanced talks to sell its 28% interest in the Shearwater field in the U.K. North Sea to Tailwind Energy Ltd., an explorer backed by trading house Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., people familiar with the matter said. Crude output at major U.S. shale plays is seen rising to 7.733 million barrels a day in June, the highest since January production of 7.78 million, according to the Energy Information Administration’s monthly Drilling Productivity Report. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said he will retire when President Hassan Rouhani’s term ends this year, closing a career that started with the birth of the Islamic Republic in 1979 and has often been defined by his country’s turbulent relationship with the U.S."

The U.K. company expects to add flights in earnest from June, a month later than planned, it said Thursday after posting a 701 million-pound ($990 million) loss for the first half through March. Uncertainty over travel restrictions will force late changes, hurting booking visibility, while costs are set to rise as pilots return from furlough. European airlines are trying to gauge how quickly they can bring back flights as governments move toward relaxing their borders while guarding against a surge in infection rates. London-based EasyJet said it’s frustrated over the approach being taken by Britain, where only 12 locations are on a so-called green list that still requires travelers to take costly tests, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged people not to fly to “amber” nations. “The government here in the U.K. are almost dismantling the framework they set up themselves,” Chief Executive Officer Johan Lundgren said on Bloomberg Television. “We’re now in a situation where green doesn’t mean green, because there are still lots of restrictions, and amber almost means red.” Shares of EasyJet traded 2.5% lower at 958.40 pence as of 10:07 a.m. in London. Lundgren said telling people not to visit places like Greece and Spain despite an amber status that permits travel while requiring self-isolation on return is “very confusing” and risks demonizing tourists. EasyJet will continue to provide flights to such countries despite Johnson’s guidance on the traffic-light system, which was introduced on Monday. Europe’s second-biggest low-cost airline is offering just 15% of its pre-virus capacity in the current quarter, compared with prior plans to deploy 20%. Still, Lundgren said he’s encouraged that progress is being made after the European Union advanced its plans for a reopening. The European Parliament may reach agreement as early as this week on allowing quarantine-free travel within the bloc from June, while EU governments on Wednesday agreed to permit entry from third countries that are deemed safe, and for vaccinated tourists. “It’s fair to say we’re definitely now in the phase of recovery,” said Lundgren. “We’re ready to pick up the demand that is going to come across the market.” EasyJet’s loss was within a previously guided range of 690 million pounds to 730 million pounds. Revenue fell to 240 million pounds compared with an estimate of 235 million pounds. Continued short-term uncertainty makes it impossible to provide further financial guidance, it said."
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-26/airplane-parking-lot-in-middle-of-nowhere-has-never-been-busier,2020-10-26T22:00:00.003Z,Airplane Parking Lot in Middle of Nowhere Has Never Been Busier,['Paul Allen'],Travel,"Aircraft engineer Dan Baker expected his career would let him see the world. And since starting as an apprentice aged 16 with British Airways in London, it’s taken him to Africa, the Caribbean, New Zealand and the Middle East, where he worked for Emirates. Now he’s in a desert of a different sort -- Australia’s vast red center. With the coronavirus pandemic upending global aviation and putting millions out of work, Baker has found an unlikely job in Alice Springs, storing and maintaining scores of grounded jumbo jets. The Asia Pacific Aircraft Storage facility in Alice Springs where the dry, desert air and cool nights make for near-perfect storage conditions.. Tom Vincent checks over aircraft at the facility. It takes a team of a dozen people up to five days to induct a plane for storage. Cathay Pacific pilots photograph their aircraft, which is headed for the APAS facility, after landing at Alice Springs Airport. “I had to do a bit of looking up to see what life would be like,” Baker, 49, says of his new surrounds, a remote town of 25,000 better known as a jumping off point for famous sights like Uluru and the Olgas. “So far, it’s been great.” The Asia Pacific Aircraft Storage facility (APAS) makes a strange and eerie sight, with the flat landscape punctuated by familiar tall tail fins against a brooding desert sky. More than 100 planes are stored at the purpose-built facility adjacent to the airport, which can keep jets maintained and ready to be brought back into service when needed. Despite spiraling Covid-19 case numbers in Europe and the U.S., some are returning to the skies. Data from aviation analytics company Cirium show the number of aircraft making at least one flight per day in the Asia-Pacific region is almost back to pre-Covid levels. That’s largely thanks to recovering domestic markets in places like China, where the outbreak is more or less under control. International routes, however, remain weak. The International Air Transport Association last month downgraded its traffic forecast for 2020 to reflect a weaker-than-expected recovery. The group, which represents some 290 airlines, now expects full-year traffic to be down 66% versus 2019, more than a previous estimate of a 63% decline. Tellingly, tail fins from Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. -- both carriers without a domestic market -- are most commonly seen at the facility. Cirium data also show the number of planes in storage around much of Asia declining. At Alice Springs, though, the numbers keep rising. Many Asian locations are too humid for long-term storage of aircraft, so planes that were parked there on the expectation of a quick return to the skies are now heading to Alice Springs, whose dry, desert air and cool nights make for near-perfect storage conditions. APAS Managing Director Tom Vincent says the idea of a storage facility in Australia’s center had been around for a long time. But the former Deutsche Bank AG debt analyst was the first to act on it, raising A$5.5 million ($4 million) and clearing a slew of regulatory requirements to build it in 2013 before accepting his first plane a year later. Vincent, 42, is planning for his facility to become the main southern hemisphere hub for long-term aircraft storage, even after the pandemic is over. He’s about to submit planning applications for a fourth expansion, including another huge fenced platform that will accommodate a further 60 wide-body jets, taking capacity to between 250 and 300 aircraft. “It’s been intense,” Vincent says of 2020. He expects the number of planes parked at APAS to eventually settle at around 200. “It’s been an incredibly difficult time for the industry. Yes, there will be certain aircraft that go back into operation, hopefully sooner rather than later, but there’s still a huge pipeline of aircraft that are going to require parking and maintenance.” Vincent has been on a necessary hiring spree, expanding to more than 80 employees, from locally hired administrative staff to highly skilled aircraft engineers like Baker. Just two weeks into his new job, Baker’s days are spent supervising a three-stage induction process for each new plane, ranging from draining the engines of fluids to ensuring every last gap and crevice in the jet’s body is sealed from dust and insects. One of the areas most at risk during long-term storage is the pitot-static system, a tiny opening at the front of every jet, and the static port, another cavity a little further along the side of the aircraft. Together, these two sensors provide airspeed data. “It’s fundamental to flight,” the New Zealand native explains from the packed dirt platform where the jets are prepared. “We get that covered up pretty quickly.” It takes a team of a dozen people up to five days to induct a plane for storage. Two of those are spent entirely on taping and covering everything to protect the engines and systems, a process that can take between 40 and 50 rolls of tape. While Vincent, an Australian who splits his time between Alice Springs and Brisbane, is reluctant to share the typical cost of storing a plane, he says every two weeks, APAS gets through a pallet of tape that costs almost A$50,000. Every plane has different requirements, depending on the manual. Airbus SE, for example, requires all passenger windows be covered and taped as well, while Boeing Co. does not. Once inducted, sealed and towed to a parking bay, each plane is on a rolling system of seven, 30 and 90-day checks. During this time, bags of desiccant in the engine bays are examined, tires are rotated and brake systems are maintained. Storing a plane is certainly not simply a matter of parking it and walking away. Vincent says aircrews can become quite nostalgic when they step off the plane for the last time. “I meet most crews as they come off the aircraft,” he says. “They’re not sure when they’re going to see the aircraft again. Usually there’s photos. We like to say we’re going to look forward to when they come back to pick them up.” Exactly when that might be remains an open question. For now, these planes sit silently in the Australian outback, a surreal monument to a different time."

Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease specialist, said “ideological rigidity” is preventing people from getting Covid-19 shots and voiced frustration at the struggle to boost vaccination rates. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa extended bans on alcohol sales and most public gatherings for two weeks as the government struggles to bring a third wave of coronavirus infections under control. The country will remain on virus alert level 4, the second-highest, although there will be adjustments to some curbs, including allowing restaurants to resume operating at half their seating capacity and gyms to reopen, Ramaphosa said Sunday in a televised address. A night-time curfew will remain in place from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. and schools will remain closed until July 26. “We have had to make difficult decisions, knowing that almost every decision carries a cost to the economy and society,” Ramaphosa said. “We remain committed to do all that we can to mitigate the impact of the lockdown on people’s livelihoods.” As the French government warns increasingly of a “fourth wave” due to the now-dominant delta variant of the coronavirus, the number of new cases remains low but is rising steadily. France reported 4,256 new cases in 24 hours, up 60% in a week based on a 7-day rolling average, and four deaths, while the number of patients in need of intensive care continues to decline. President Emmanuel Macron is scheduled to address the nation Monday evening, when he’s expected to speak about the risks of the delta variant and measures to counter its rapid spread, including mandatory vaccination for healthcare personnel. Separately, a key Macron ally said France must “live with the virus” rather than count on a new lockdown to contain the spread of a new variant of Covid-19. The country could reintroduce limits on the number of people allowed in bars, restaurants and other venues, and extend the use of the so-called “health pass,” junior minister for European affairs Clement Beaune said on Europe 1 radio Sunday. New York state reported one death from Covid-19 on Sunday, even as new cases are rising and the positive test rate topped 1% for the first time since late May. Another 666 infections were reported by Governor Andrew Cuomo, with the seven-day average increasing after a dip to the level of a month ago. The delta variant accounts for 26% of New York City’s cases, which are also increasing, the city health department reported last week. That is about half the percentage nationally, according to the most recent estimate from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Eric Adams, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, said he’d recommend that vaccinated residents also wear masks in public indoor settings given the spread of the delta variant. “I believe that we should err on the side of caution,” Adams said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “I still wear my mask from time to time when I’m in crowded settings.” Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease specialist, said “ideological rigidity” is preventing people from getting Covid-19 shots and voiced frustration at the struggle to boost vaccination rates in parts of the country. “It’s not an easy solution,” Fauci said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. “We’ve got to get away from this divisiveness that has really been a problem right from the very beginning with this outbreak.” With vaccination rates lagging mostly in southern and Midwestern states, Fauci made the rounds of U.S. Sunday morning talk shows to reinforce the Biden administration’s message that Covid shots are safe and offer strong protection against the delta variant that’s now dominant in the U.S. Libya reinstated a partial lockdown for two weeks, ordering the closing of restaurants and cafes and banning social gatherings, after reporting its highest-ever number of daily Covid-19 cases. Authorities also cut working hours at government institutions and reduced staffing to 25% capacity. The North African nation recorded 2,854 positive cases on Saturday. The U.S. reported 33,933 new cases Saturday, the most since mid-May, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg. New infections rose for the third consecutive week as the delta variant sweeps through pockets of unvaccinated Americans, jumping to almost 134,000 for the week ending Saturday. That compares with about 92,400 for the previous week. Another 319 deaths were reported Saturday. Weekly fatalities were up slightly from the previous seven days, but still about half the level of early May. Separately, U.S. vaccinations have plunged, despite the spread of the delta variant that is fueling a new rise in infections. The U.S. recorded 599,000 vaccinations on Saturday, the lowest level since early January, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. Daily vaccinations peaked in mid-April at almost 4 million. President Joe Biden missed his goal of administering at least one dose of vaccine to 70% of adults in the U.S. by July 4. That number is now 67.5%, according to the CDC. The U.K. government plans to issue guidance that people are expected to continue wearing masks indoors, in crowds and on public transportation even after mandatory mandates are lifted in England on July 19, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC TV on Sunday. Separately, Britain’s biggest business lobby called on the government to drop self-isolation rules when other Covid restrictions end, seeking to inject confidence into a push to get workers back to offices. A work-from-home recommendation expires July 19, but self-isolation rules for fully vaccinated contacts of those who have tested positive for the coronavirus are set to be maintained until Aug. 16. U.K. officials asked the nation’s vaccination committee to shorten the gap between coronavirus vaccinations to four weeks in a push to accelerate the administration of second doses, according to The Sunday Times. The request for advice on shortening wait times comes amid surging infections of the virus’s delta variant. Health experts say that while full vaccination provides protection against serious illness and death from variants including delta, one dose is far less effective. Officials in Moscow believe the city has passed the peak of infections and will start to see levels stabilize, RIA Novosti reported on Sunday, citing the capital’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin. Russia has reported more than 700 deaths in each of the past six days, with the seven-day average hitting a high of 725. Data collected in Israel suggests that the protection afforded by the Pfizer Inc.- BioNTech SE vaccination weakens over time, the Ynet news website reported. People who were among the earliest vaccinated figure prominently among the new cases, though even among this group, protection against severe illness remains strong, according to the data presented to the Health Ministry. Separately, Israel reached an agreement with Pfizer to bring forward a planned delivery of coronavirus vaccine to Aug. 1, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said on Sunday. Eric Adams, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, said he’d recommend that vaccinated residents also wear masks in public indoor settings given the spread of the delta variant. The U.K. government plans to issue guidance that people are expected to continue wearing masks in many public settings even after mandates are lifted in England. French officials warned of a new wave of infection, though a minister said the nation is unlikely to impose more lockdowns. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa extended bans on alcohol sales and most public gatherings as the government struggles to bring a third viral wave under control. More than 80% of North American movie theaters were open this weekend, setting a pandemic record for box office sales, Comscore reported. At the start of the year, 35% of theaters were open. This weekend, “Black Widow,” a Disney film starring Scarlett Johansson as a former KGB assassin, broke the pandemic record, generating $80 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters. It also drew more than $60 million from viewers who paid $30 to watch it at home, Disney reported.  Los Angeles County added 1,113 new cases, the highest in four months, as health officials warned of the spread of the delta variant. New cases also exceeded 1,000 for a third straight day, with the positive test rate at 2.5%. On Friday, the county said its case loads doubled from a week earlier. Four new deaths were added. Statewide, California’s test positivity rate stands at 2.3%, one of the highest levels since early March.

Around two hours later, she was back in the same airport and loading up on duty-free shopping, despite never landing in another country. The Air Busan Co. flight, organized by Lotte Duty Free for its VIP customers, was Hyun’s first since the pandemic began and it didn’t cost her a cent. Because the route briefly departed Korean airspace and went over a Japanese island, the 130 passengers on board qualified to shop at duty-free stores in Seoul typically reserved for people who have traveled internationally. A passenger receives his duty free purchase while on a flight to nowhere on a Korean carrier. Source: Jeju Air Co. Destination-less flights like these are an attempt by duty-free operators to salvage an industry decimated by Covid-19. Before the virus, business was booming -- the global duty-free market was worth $85 billion in 2019 and on track to reach $139 billion by 2027, according to Verified Market Research. Sales plunged as countries restricted international travel. Globally, only 1.8 billion people took scheduled flights last year compared with 4.5 billion in 2019, the International Civil Aviation Organization has said. Annual revenue for Swiss duty-free giant Dufry AG, which operates outlets worldwide, fell 71%. While shoppers on flights such as Hyun’s won’t fill the financial void, they at least bring in some much-needed business. “I saw a lot of people with bags full of duty-free items,” said Hyun, who bought a Chanel bag, shoes and cosmetics. “I tell all my friends that it’s worth taking the flight because of the duty-free shopping opportunity.” Hotel Shilla, South Korea’s second-biggest duty-free operator after Lotte, is offering 114 seats on two so-called flights to nowhere on May 23 and 30 to customers who have spent more than $550 at its stores since May 3. Lotte is putting on another five flights this month. Duty-free operators and other stores are among the last in South Korea to recover from the pandemic, with the country’s retailers and wholesalers shedding 182,000 positions in April even as the economy added 652,000 jobs from a year earlier, the statistics office reported Wednesday. The industry is in less of a squeeze where domestic air traffic has rebounded and tax-free shopping zones are in place. The palm-fringed Chinese island of Hainan has become an even more popular getaway for tourists from the mainland now starved of international travel. That’s helped the province’s duty-free sales, which more than doubled to 27.5 billion yuan ($4.3 billion) last year, according to the Ministry of Commerce. Duty-free shopping has been permitted for domestic tourists in Hainan since 2011. In July, the government raised the spending limit to allow people to buy more and it is extending some duty-free shopping to Beijing, Shanghai and other cities to tap the growing purchasing power trapped in China. Catering to the demand in Hainan, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s logistics unit is starting daily cargo flights from Singapore to deliver cosmetics, handbags and other goods to the island. Japan’s leading duty-free retailer, Laox Co., which was acquired by Chinese retailer Suning Holdings Group Co. in 2009, is planning to enter Hainan as soon as the second half of this year, setting up stores designed similarly to its outlets in Japan. “The trend of visiting Hainan to do luxury shopping is here to stay for the Chinese,” said Jonathan Siboni, chief executive officer of data-intelligence firm Luxurynsight. International air travel, if it is happening at all, is tending toward shorter-haul, regional routes, and from places where vaccination programs are at a more advanced stage. Seven of the world’s busiest international routes in the first four months of the year included U.S. links, such as Cancun-Houston and New York-Santo Domingo, according to aviation analytics company Cirium. Share prices suggest investors are upbeat. Dufry’s stock has climbed more than 100% since the end of September, while Hotel Shilla is near the highest in nearly 15 months in Seoul, rallying 13% this year.  Paris-based Lagardere Travel Retail, which operates duty-free stores, restaurants and other shops in airports, is counting on customers from closer to home to help it through an uncertain summer in Europe after its revenue slid 56% from a year earlier to 341 million euros ($414 million) in the first three months. “We’re betting more on retired Europeans traveling,” said Frederic Chevalier, the company’s chief operating officer for Europe, Middle East and Africa. McKinsey forecasts passenger flows between Asia and Europe will only return to 2019 levels “beyond 2024,” said Anita Balchandani, a partner at the firm. With vaccination rates lagging in places such as South Korea -- which has delivered enough jabs for just 4% of the population, Bloomberg’s Virus Tracker shows -- retailers may rely on gimmicks like flights to nowhere for a while. “The contribution from the flights to nowhere is small but it’s better than having nothing,” said Sung Junewon, an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp. In Seoul. “Every little bit counts.” Seven South Korean carriers have operated these flights, carrying about 8,000 passengers in total. Authorities are also considering plans to allow overseas flights into Incheon, where passengers can spend a few hours shopping without leaving the airport before flying back to their original departure point. Park Ju-hyun, a 31-year-old office worker from Seoul, paid about 90,000 won ($80) for a flight-to-nowhere ticket in March. It was her first time on a plane since a trip to the Philippines before the pandemic, and it was well worth it for the shopping, said Park, who spent about $600, mostly on cosmetics. “It was nice to be back at the airport,” she said."

The airline group reported an operating loss of 7.43 billion euros ($9 billion) in 2020, according to a statement Friday. While Chief Executive Officer Luis Gallego expressed growing confidence that a recovery will take shape, IAG said it can’t provide an outlook for the current year as the coronavirus pandemic continues to batter air travel. Heathrow Touts U.K. to Lead Long-Haul Flight Revival (2) Airline Bookings Surge, Buoyed by U.K. Plans to Reopen Travel Carriers specializing in long-haul routes have suffered the worst of the downturn, with the International Air Transport Association predicting some inter-continental markets could take years to revive. Airlines such as London-based IAG are counting on so-called Covid passports to help spur a quicker rebound as vaccine rollouts accelerate in countries including the U.K. “We have seen a big increase in flight and holiday bookings for the summer following the U.K. government announcement,” Gallego said on a media call. “Vaccination development, international common standards and digital health passes will be key.” Shares of IAG traded 3.1% higher as of 3:16 p.m. in London, taking gains this year to 20% after they lost almost two-thirds of their value in 2020. IAG’s operating loss included exceptional charges of 3 billion euros against plane retirements, restructuring and fuel-hedging measures. The company has had to cut jobs, borrow money and sell stock to stay afloat, with BA particularly hard because of its reliance on a trans-Atlantic market that’s still virtually closed. The carrier group had 10.3 billion euros in liquidity at the start of 2021, it said in a presentation. IAG won’t need any additional funding and will be focused on how to capture demand as it returns, Chief Financial Officer Steve Gunning said. “If there is a strong summer, and there is increasing confidence of that, it’s a case of how quickly you can ramp up capacity and introduce additional seats,” Gunning said on the call. While countries work on plans to restore flights, short-haul specialists such as EasyJet Plc are expecting a quicker rebound as the U.K.’s inoculation program helps lift leisure bookings. “A question mark still hangs over when it will be practical for British nationals to take foreign holidays again,” said Jack Winchester, an analyst at Third Bridge Ltd. “This is holding back a dam of pent up demand, and IAG will be desperate to see that unleashed.” Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA separately reported a full-year loss of 23 billion kroner ($2.7 billion). The carrier said it had recognized impairment losses of 12.8 billion kroner on the terminated aircraft purchase contracts, which drove up the loss.  The Scandinavian carrier is restructuring under an examinership process in an Irish court and will offer a detailed plan next week.  Norwegian Air has said it plans to raise new funding in late March or early April, and focus on regional flights with smaller aircraft. The carrier has turned away from the low-cost, long-haul business that put price pressure on major carriers like British Airways, which counds on North America for about 30% of its capacity. IAG attempted to purchase Norwegian Air in 2018 but dropped the plan after its bids were rejected and losses mounted at the smaller company."

A panel chaired by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha on Friday approved curtailing the quarantine to 10 days from two weeks starting April 1, Traisuree Taisaranakul, a government spokeswoman, told reporters in Bangkok. The country may stop enforcing quarantine altogether from Oct. 1 though the group delayed a decision on cutting isolation period to seven days for vaccinated tourists as recommended by an expert group last week, officials said. More Than 400 Million Shots Given: Covid-19 Tracker A shorter quarantine is expected to make Thailand -- famed for its palm-fringed beaches, temples and backpacker culture -- more attractive to millions of foreign tourists and is seen as a key step toward a wider reopening. Still, tourism-reliant Thailand’s reluctance to fully ease curbs point to the dilemma faced by authorities in balancing the need to protect people from fresh outbreaks while bolstering economic activities. The pandemic has devastated Thailand’s tourism industry, which provided more than $60 billion in revenue from about 40 million foreign visitors in 2019. A government campaign to boost travel by locals through hotel and air travel concessions has failed to make up for the slump in earnings as strict quarantine rules have kept most foreign travelers away. A deserted Bangla Road in Patong, Phuket in December 2020. The easing measures fell short of the tourism industry’s expectations with the Tourism Council of Thailand calling for free entry of vaccinated travelers to save the sector. “We should reopen for vaccinated visitors as soon as possible. We can’t wait any longer,” said Suthipong Phuenphiphop, a vice president of the tourism council, who also heads the Thai Travel Agents Association. “It’s been a year and the industry is suffering, and if we have to wait until Oct. 1, it’s going to be too late.” READ: What Are Vaccine Passports and How Would They Work? The Prayuth-led panel opted to assess the results of the ongoing inoculation drive and responses of other countries toward travel bubble agreements before approving vaccine passports for local residents, Rachada Dhnadirek, another government spokeswoman, said. Thailand is in talks with the U.S., South Korea and Singapore for vaccine passport pacts, according to Don Pramudwinai, deputy premier and foreign minister. The government is prepared to lower the quarantine to seven days for vaccinated travelers once the nation is ready though a 14-day isolation will continue for those coming from areas with new virus strains, said Taweesilp Witsanuyotin, a spokesman for the Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration. Despite a flare-up in infections earlier this year, Thailand has largely contained Covid-19, with just 90 deaths over the course of the pandemic. Authorities closed a large market complex in capital Bangkok this week to contain a spike in infections tied to the cluster ahead of a peak travel period during the Thai New Year next month. The government will not impose any travel restrictions during the Songkran festival, Rachada said. People walk along Khaosan Road at night in Bangkok on March 12. The Covid panel also approved the extension of a national state of emergency for two months through the end of May to deal with the pandemic. The emergency rules, first imposed in March last year, allow the government to enforce mandatory quarantines and streamline disease-control plans without multiple approvals from various agencies. Thailand has administered more than 60,000 doses of vaccines since the start of its rollout on Feb. 28. It has prioritized healthcare and front-line workers, as well as residents in tourist hotspots, such as Phuket and Koh Samui, the two islands where local tourism groups also target Oct. 1 for the full reopening.

This could mean a “return leg exemption” so passengers only pay for their outward flight, or a new lower domestic rate. The proposal forms part of the so-called Union Connectivity Review, led by Network Rail Chairman Peter Hendy, which has been tasked with exploring how transport can better connect all parts of the U.K. It follows the collapse of Flybe at the start of the coronavirus pandemic that severed links to far-flung parts of the country. A plan to revive Flybe suffered a setback last week when a hedge fund backer walked away from the project, according to U.K. media reports. But a cut in domestic APD would benefit only a tiny proportion of routes and do little to answer the concerns of carriers that have demanded sweeping measures to revive U.K. aviation, at a time when some European rivals are benefiting from billions of euros in state funding. It will also stir the ire of environmental campaigners who regard any support for air travel as a retrograde step as other forms of transport cut carbon emissions faster. Johnson said in a statement: “It’s now time to build back better in a way which brings every corner of the U.K. closer together. We will harness the incredible power of infrastructure to level up parts of our country that have too long been left off the transport map.” The government first announced a consultation on APD in March 2020, but this was delayed due to the pandemic, the Department of Transport said. In an emailed statement, it pledged to “continue to decarbonise domestic aviation as part of our ambition to reach net zero, including through mandating the use of sustainable aviation fuel.” The Airport Operators Association welcomed the move, saying it “offers a glimmer of hope for the future.” But Doug Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace U.K., said in an emailed statement: “After the fuel duty freeze and rail fare rises, cutting duty on domestic flights would continue our nonsensical trend of the higher the carbon, the lower the tax.”"

A second summer lost to the coronavirus crisis would likely trigger a spate of airline failures and bankruptcy filings, alongside a repeat of 2020’s bailouts, job cuts, and jetliner deferrals and cancellations, according consultants IBA Group. Ryanair passenger jets on the tarmac at London Stansted Airport. Johnson Wins U.K. Parliament Backing for Plan to Lift Lockdown A lone passenger waits by the check-in counters at Nice Cote d’Azur Airport. Aircraft operated by Air France-KLM at Schiphol Airport. In just the past week, the optimism that took the Bloomberg World Airlines Index to the highest since the start of the pandemic has evaporated. TUI AG, the world’s biggest tour operator, scaled back its summer schedule to reflect a peak season that won’t start until July, at least two months later than normal. Ryanair Holdings Plc held a press briefing to reassure would-be holidaymakers they could change flights for free and exhorted them not to be “panicked” by negative headlines. “The ground is shifting from one day to the next,” IBA’s Stuart Hatcher said in an interview. Governments are aware that pushing back the reopening of travel will mean more pain for the aviation industry but have been spooked by resurgent infection rates even as vaccine rollouts continue, he said. European carriers especially have felt the gloom that’s set in because of rising cases and fresh lockdowns. Leisure-focused companies such as TUI and Ryanair usually use the first three months of the year taking summer bookings, giving them a cash stockpile to work with as they gear up operations. Any wiggle room is swiftly contracting. TUI, which caters to German and British travelers who flood to the Mediterranean during the warmer months, said Thursday it has enough liquidity to last “until the summer,” without being more specific. British Airways owner IAG SA secured a new loan using its coveted takeoff and landing slots at London Heathrow airport as collateral. Travel needs to restart in earnest by July 1 or carriers risk missing out on the handful of months that will provide the bulk of annual earnings, Air France-KLM Chief Executive Officer Ben Smith said Thursday. “What’s critical about July is that Q3, for the majority of European carriers, is the key quarter to make it through the year,” Smith said in a briefing held by the Airlines for Europe lobby. The group is pushing for the rapid adoption of so-called vaccine passports and an end to quarantines it says crush demand. While 45 airlines failed in 2020, many more have been hanging on in hopes of an imminent revival of leisure markets, Hatcher said. That’s looking less likely as the year develops, with Airports Council International on Thursday forecasting global passenger traffic will remain almost 50% below usual levels this year. While most carriers could survive a delayed summer, the cost to bail them out would be considerable. Even before the latest setbacks, the International Air Transport Association said carriers would need as much as $80 billion more in government money this year. In Europe, Air France-KLM is seeking further aid on top of 10.4 billion euros ($12 billion) in loans and guarantees granted last year. TUI, which has taken 4.8 billion euros in German government aid, gave no financial forecast at its annual meeting on Thursday, promising only that cash flow will trend toward breakeven as business normalizes. The airport sector will also need state support, the ACI group said, warning that even large hubs are struggling. The industry is “in a precarious situation right now,” the trade association’s economist Patrick Lucas said. Discount carriers such as Ryanair, EasyJet Plc and Wizz Air Holdings Plc have strong liquidity positions and easy options for boosting reserves through aircraft sale-and-leaseback deals if necessary. There could also be an extension of $50 billion of Cares Act loans and worker payments in the U.S. and a similar continuation of furloughs in Europe and elsewhere. Even then, airlines may need to deepen cost cuts. More carriers are likely to pursue local bankruptcy protection where that’s possible, following companies like Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. Major Latin American carriers including Latam Airlines Group SA, Avianca Holdings SA and Grupo Aeromexico SAB that secured U.S. Chapter 11 protection for their main businesses in the absence of state bailouts at home are likely to seek extensions if cash flows fail to revive, Hatcher said. IBA anticipates moves to rationalize supply in Asia, where aircraft order books remain bloated, especially in Southeast Asia and India, and airline failures have been limited. Mergers like that between Korean Air Lines Co.’s and national rival Asiana Airlines Inc. may become more common. A cash crunch will have further implications for airline fleet plans, prompting the retirement of more older planes and extended deferrals of new deliveries. Outright order cancellations would become more likely at Airbus SE and Boeing Co. China Aircraft Leasing Group Holdings Ltd. this week reduced an order for Boeing’s 737 Max model to 66 planes from 92, and will push out the delivery schedule for some of the remaining aircraft. Airbus lost 92 plane orders last month, mostly from insolvent Norwegian Air. While the number of airline failures last year was comparable with recent peaks in 2019 and 2011, aircraft exits hit an all-time high. Some 1,500 planes were retired early by reasonably healthy airlines, while operators in bankruptcy or full collapse added 800 to the total, according to IBA. All told, aircraft exits are likely to approach 3,000 since the start of the pandemic. Airlines and travel firms are now waiting for U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson to deliver his verdict on reopening travel from Britain in an update set for April 5. A targeted date of May 17 is expected to be pushed back. “The market is there, the customers want to travel,” said Fritz Joussen, TUI’s CEO. “However, the conditions for tourism need to be created at the political level.”"

The 160 single-aisle planes would be destined for the Transavia discount division and European operations at KLM, a spokesman said Monday. The brands currently operate only Boeing jets on short- and mid-range routes. The contest will pit Boeing’s resurgent 737 Max against Airbus’s A320neo-series narrow-bodies. The fleet at Transavia, which has French and Dutch divisions, comprises mostly 737-800s, and the addition of aircraft from another manufacturer would go against the strategy of budget rivals like EasyJet Plc, which stick to a single type to keep down costs. KLM also operates 737s and has been standardizing around Boeing models for long-haul flights. Boeing and Airbus didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Air France-KLM Chief Executive Officer Ben Smith has made the expansion of low-cost operations a key element of plans to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. He aims to as much as triple the number of Transavia jets based in France after the group lost market share there to low-cost competitors. Boeing has had a string of sales wins with the Max, which was grounded for 18 months after fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. United Airlines Holdings Inc. last month agreed to buy 200 of the planes, while handing Airbus an order for 70 of its larger A321neos. Southwest Airlines Co., which has an all-737 fleet, topped up its Max backlog by 100 planes in March, after considering the Airbus A220. Any order at Air France-KLM would come after the company last year received loans and guarantees worth 10.4 billion euros ($12 billion) from France and the Netherlands, which are both shareholders, followed by a further 4 billion euros in debt conversion and fresh capital backed by Paris in April. The latest rescue saw France’s stake edge toward 30% and was approved by European Union competition authorities on condition that the aid not be used to fund aggressive commercial expansion. The European Commission declined to comment Monday on the airline’s fleet plans, while saying that officials continue to monitor conditions attached to their approval of the French investment. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire last year called on Air France to be a good customer for Airbus, which is based in the southern French city of Toulouse. The Netherlands has been exploring providing more funding to KLM for months. The timing of that support is up to the government, Smith was quoted as saying in an interview with Het Financieele Dagblad, which also reported on the potential order. Air France is expecting deliveries in September from an order for 60 Airbus A220s to be used on its own short-haul routes, though the model would be too small for the KLM and Transavia requirements. Smith has urged Airbus to make a stretched version of the plane. The Cityhopper regional division of KLM operates smaller aircraft but already has deliveries outstanding for the latest E2 jets from Embraer SA. Air France-KLM shares fell 3.2% as of 2:38 p.m. in Paris on Monday, while Airbus was up 0.1%. Boeing shares were off 0.8% in premarket U.S. trading.

Fewer German companies are worried they may go out of business due to the pandemic, according to a June survey by the Ifo research institute, with only 14% of those polled saying they feared for their existence, down from 19% in February. Companies in the events industry “are still particularly at risk,” with more than 70% concerned about going out of business, said Ifo’s head of polling, Klaus Wohlrabe. Covid is fueling a productivity boost for the U.S. economy by speeding up workplace digitization, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which said annualized growth in output per hour has risen 3.1% since the crisis began, compared with 1.4% in the previous business cycle.

The number of Sydney residents hospitalized from Covid-19 increased to 65 as the Australian city struggles to contain an outbreak of the delta variant. A man in his 70s died, the second fatality in the past week from an outbreak that’s grown to more than 700 cases since mid-June. The hospitalizations are a worrying sign that authorities may impose tighter movement restrictions after Sydney was placed into a lockdown on June 26 as the city battles its largest coronavirus outbreak in more than a year. Mary-Louise McLaws, a professor at the University of New South Wales and adviser to the World Health Organization, told Bloomberg Television that Sydney should have locked down earlier.

Finance Minister Grant Robertson said New Zealand’s border curbs “will be with us for some time” as the pandemic continues to evolve, but there are opportunities to refine the approach as vaccination rates increase. Australia has a “firm commitment” to launch a quarantine-free travel bubble with Singapore, Australia’s top diplomat to the city-state said. The plan is now more likely to occur by the end of the year due to the outbreak in Sydney, Australia’s High Commissioner to Singapore Will Hodgman said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “There’s a very strong commitment for officials, both governments in Australia and here in Singapore, to progress the systems -- the operational capabilities, the requirements -- that will be necessary to ensure safe travel,” Hodgman said.

In the U.S., regulators added a warning to Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine about a rare immune-system disorder. Mexico recorded 11,137 Covid-19 cases Tuesday, the most since Feb. 10, according to government data. Deaths rose by 219. Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said while cases have increased there have been fewer deaths due to the vaccinations. Vaccine safety and Guillain-Barré Syndrome will be the focus of an immunization advisory committee scheduled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on July 22. The announcement comes a day after the fact sheet for Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 shot was revised by federal regulators to warn about a “small possible risk” for the rare condition in which the immune system attacks the nerves. Greece reported 3,109 new cases Tuesday, the highest daily rise in just over two months. To combat the recent increase amid concerns for its tourism industry, authorities said customers of indoor restaurants and indoor areas at entertainment venues will need to show they’ve been vaccinated or have tested negative within the last three days. The requirement will remain in force until the end of August at the earliest, and doesn’t concern outdoor areas. Spain, Europe’s second largest tourism market pre-pandemic, is still a safe destination, Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto said on Tuesday after Germany and France earlier warned citizens about the risks of heading there. Catalonia and Valencia, two of the most popular vacation spots, have both seen a surge in infections in recent days as restrictions are relaxed. Weekly cases in the Netherlands surged more than sixfold with 51,957 infections reported by the Dutch health service in the week ending July 13. Last week’s tally was 8,541 cases. On Friday, the Dutch government announced it would reintroduce some pandemic restrictions in a bid to reduce the rising number of infections. Nightclubs were closed until August 13 and the opening hours of bars were reduced. Dutch caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte publicly apologized on Monday for making an “error in judgement” and easing restrictions too quickly. Scotland will stick with its plan to lift more coronavirus restrictions, though it will diverge from England’s reopening next week by keeping face coverings mandatory in stores and other public places and maintaining working from home as government policy. Hospitality venues will need to close at midnight and there will still be social-distancing restrictions at bars and restaurants. The ratio of deaths per 100 confirmed cases would place it fourth-highest among countries tracked by Johns Hopkins University, trailing only Peru, Mexico and Afghanistan. The rate falls to 2.8% if only cases where Covid-19 was determined to be the main cause of death are included, according to the city’s health department. Tanzania’s semi-autonomous Zanzibar archipelago began vaccinations after downplaying the extent of the pandemic for more than a year. “The Sinovac vaccines were originally meant to be administered to people who wanted to attend the annual Hajj pilgrimage,” Zanzibar’s Health Ministry Permanent Secretary Omar Shajak said. “After Saudi Arabia prohibited foreign visitors due to the coronavirus outbreak, we decided to give those vaccines to our front-line workers.” Tanzania’s move leaves Eritrea and Burundi as the only African countries yet to start vaccinating. South Africa’s vaccination program has been partially halted as violent protests following the imprisonment of former President Jacob Zuma rage in two key provinces. State-administered inoculations have been suspended in KwaZulu-Natal and parts of Gauteng, the economic hub, said Nicholas Crisp, a consultant to the National Health Department who helps oversee the program. “We are clearly not going to be putting our staff in harm’s way,” Crisp said in an interview Tuesday, adding that those queuing for vaccines could also be in danger. “It will just have to wait until things calm down.” The health department had expected to exceed 200,000 vaccinations on Monday, but only 146,000 people got vaccinated. The incidence rate of Covid has increased by 60% in the past week, and has reached alarming levels in eight French regions including the Paris area, government spokesman Gabriel Attal said Tuesday. The Delta variant now represents more than 60% of new infections, he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel reinforced the government’s urgent appeal for people to get vaccinated, saying the inoculation campaign will be the deciding factor for the future course of the pandemic. “The more are vaccinated, the more free we can be again,” Merkel said Tuesday during a visit to the RKI public-health institute. Still, Germany won’t follow France in requiring compulsory vaccination for health workers, she said. The tightest curbs so far imposed on Java, Indonesia’s most-populated island, and Bali, the tourism spot, haven’t eased people’s movement as much as the government expected. Mobility has only eased by 6%-16% since the restrictions whereas authorities had expected a 20% drop, Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said in a hearing with lawmakers on Tuesday. The government had earlier said that a 50% drop in mobility is needed to cut back on infections. Russia reported 780 deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours, the highest number since the start of the pandemic as its health-care system strained against a third wave of infections. A spike in hospitalizations driven by the delta variant has led several regions to announce mandatory vaccinations in the last month. The measures have boosted demand for home-grown inoculations, with about 20% of Russians receiving at least one dose of a vaccine to date. Germany plans to simplify its travel rules, the Funke media group reported, citing a draft of a Health Ministry document. The proposals include reducing the number of Covid-19 risk area types to two from three. A very high incidence rate and “other quantitative and qualitative” factors would dictate which countries are high risk. France added Tunisia, Mozambique, Cuba and Indonesia to its so-called red list, an official said. The U.K. remains on the orange list, but non-vaccinated people arriving in the country will have to show a negative test no older than 24 hours. Spain and Portugal remain on the green list, but non-vaccinated travelers will also need to present a test. Singapore’s daily infection tally hit the highest in almost a month as authorities started investigating new cases from karaoke lounges and clubs. The uptick in cases may fuel concerns of a delay in rolling back restrictions although the government has said it is drawing up a roadmap that treats Covid-19 as endemic. Russia signed a deal with the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer to boost annual production of Sputnik V shots by 300 million doses in India as the South Asian nation struggles with supplies. The Serum Institute of India Ltd., which is already producing AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine, aims to deliver its first batch of Sputnik V by September, the company and the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund, which backed the vaccine’s development and is in charge of its foreign sales, said in a joint statement. More than half of all adults in the EU are fully vaccinated, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a tweet. The bloc has enough doses to immunize 70% of its adult population, she said.

Aside from Pratasevich and his girlfriend, three more passengers stayed in Minsk, sparking scrutiny of their motivations as the affair ignited international outrage. That intensified after Pratasevich’s allies reported his concern about being followed in Athens. Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary alleged KGB agents were on board the aircraft, though his claim hasn’t been confirmed. Belarus state television stirred further intrigue when it identified Iason Zisis, a Greek national, as being among those who failed to reembark, along with two Belarusians. When contacted by Bloomberg, Zisis, a researcher in advanced computational engineering, confirmed that he was on the flight and said the diversion turned out to save time for him. “I was flying to Minsk anyway, with an evening connection in Vilnius,” Zisis said on LinkedIn. After the interruption, as passengers lined up to return to the aircraft, “I stood at the back of the queue and I asked to stay, and they allowed me.” The episode -- with a fighter jet escort and armed officers in guard -- was unsettling for most passengers, provoking international outcry and investigations by European security agencies. But some of those on board have said they had not realized the forced landing took place to snatch a dissident off the flight until they reached Vilnius. Zisis, who has a PhD in scientific computing from Eindhoven University of Technology, said that all the information he had at the time was from the pilot: that the plane was landing in Minsk for security reasons. He wasn’t aware of the arrest until later. Zisis, who lives in Patras, Southern Greece, said that he was heading to Minsk to visit his wife, who lives there. A Greek government official, who asked not to be named, said that the investigation so far hasn’t indicated Zisis’s involvement in the incident or any connections to security services. Greece’s foreign ministry hasn’t commented. Zisis says that he finds it inexcusable that journalists were the first to track him and reach him, and not the Greek government. He said that no one had called to confirm his whereabouts and whether he’s O.K. when he was missing from the list of passengers who landed in Vilnius after the diversion. Zisis, whose research interests include hypervelocity impacts and computational fluid dynamics, says he plans to stay in Minsk with his wife for the time being, despite a looming flights embargo and that he had no issues with authorities there about his stay."

Representative Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat who was leading the push, said Republicans halted his attempt to bring up the measure, which needed unanimous backing by all House members to pass on such short notice. Republicans said they viewed the unusual maneuver skeptically. That effectively ended hopes until next week at the earliest for payroll assistance to struggling carriers, which have already begun laying off tens of thousands of workers. Republicans “killed this legislation, plain and simple,” DeFazio, chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said on the House floor. His legislation would have provided more than $28 billion for airlines and contractors if they held off on layoffs until March 31, 2021. The House isn’t scheduled to return to Washington until after the election. A deal could only pass with unanimous consent while members are away, although House leaders have warned they could call members back for votes, which would require a lower threshold of support to pass. The back and forth whipsawed airline stocks, which fell early in the session and then jumped on Pelosi’s announcement that she would push for a stand-alone measure to help carriers. A Standard & Poor’s index of U.S. airlines pared gains after the aid was blocked but still advanced 2.3% at the close in New York. Payroll support of $25 billion for passenger carriers expired Sept. 30, prompting American Airlines Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. to start laying off tens of thousands of employees. Attempts to provide assistance to push the layoffs back for another six months have so far failed as Pelosi, the White House and Senate Republicans sought agreement on a broader relief bill. Republicans believed the unusual process of trying to push an airline-specific bill through so quickly was unnecessarily partisan, said one GOP staffer who asked not to be named while discussing deliberations. Democrats didn’t consult with Republicans and the bill’s budget effects hadn’t been evaluated, the person said. He called the attempt incomplete and sloppy. Earlier Friday, Pelosi issued a statement saying an agreement on airline aid “is being reached.” After the measure was blocked, she slammed the other party. “Again and again, Democrats offer legislation to save lives and livelihoods, only to be met by more Republican obstruction,” she said. She had urged airlines to hold off on layoffs until lawmakers could pass an assistance bill.  Pelosi’s support of stand-alone legislation proposed by DeFazio signaled a newfound willingness to provide airline aid outside of a comprehensive economic rescue package. But it also came at a time of heavy political maneuvering during the lead-up to the November elections in which both parties are trying to blame the other for a lack of Covid-19 aid. Hit by an unprecedented travel slump because of the coronavirus pandemic, airlines have been parking jets, paring flight schedules and asking employees to accept voluntary separation deals such as buyouts and temporary leave. “We are disheartened that Congress and the Administration have been unable to reach an agreement that would save tens of thousands of highly skilled, quality jobs in the U.S. airline industry,” said Nicholas Calio, president of Airlines for America, a trade group. American and United said they could recall furloughed workers if Congress acted. Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. didn’t immediately comment. “Aviation workers cannot wait,” said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA. “While Congress and the administration continue to negotiate a broader deal, we are out of time.” Assistance to pay for airline payrolls has received widespread support. President Donald Trump and a group of Republican senators have previously said they supported the goal. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters Friday that the chief executive officer of American Airlines called him. “The airlines need some help,” Kudlow said. A bill introduced by Republican senators Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Susan Collins of Maine on Sept. 21 would give passenger air carriers, cargo air carriers, and airline contractors an additional $28 billion in pandemic aid to cover payrolls. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hasn’t said whether he supports a standalone relief bill for airlines."

The deal for Mumbai International Airport Ltd., India’s second busiest, makes Adani Airport Holdings Ltd. the nation’s largest airport infrastructure company, accounting for 25% of all passenger traffic and 33% of air cargo, according to a statement late Tuesday. While the coronavirus pandemic has devastated the global aviation industry, Adani is taking a longer view, betting on an Indian air-transport market that is forecast to become the world’s third-largest by 2026, according to the International Air Transport Association. “While the world navigates its way out of an unprecedented crisis, post-pandemic demand for air travel in India and the rest of the world is expected to surge,” Adani Airport said in the statement. Adani Airport will “cater to a 300-million-strong post-pandemic consumer base comprising fliers and non-fliers.” Shares of Adani Enterprises rose as much as 2.6% in early Mumbai trading Wednesday, before erasing gains to be little changed. Adani is seeking a loan of about 75 billion rupees ($1 billion) to refinance the airport’s 80 billion rupees debt, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month. Adani Airport in August agreed to acquire the debt of GVK Airport Developers Ltd., and bought a 23.5% stake in the gateway from Airports Co. South Africa and Bidvest Group Ltd. Mumbai International Airport separately this week plans to raise around $389 million selling rupee-denominated one- and two-year 11% bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The deal catapults Adani Enterprises into the major leagues, pitting it against GMR Infrastructure Ltd., which controls India’s busiest international airport in New Delhi. Adani, which operates six airports in India, is expecting its share of passenger traffic to grow to 100 million people in 2022 from 80 million last year with the Mumbai acquisition. “Our larger objective is to reinvent airports as ecosystems that drive local economic development and act as the nuclei around which we can catalyze aviation-linked businesses,” Gautam Adani said in the statement. “These include metropolitan developments that span entertainment facilities, e-commerce and logistics capabilities, aviation dependent industries, smart city developments, and other innovative business concepts.”"

Hong Kong and Singapore will announce a start to their highly anticipated two-way air travel bubble as soon as Monday, according to people familiar with the matter, after multiple delays. Flights under the agreement -- which allows people to travel quarantine free between the financial hubs -- will begin from May 26, said the people, who asked not to be identified as they’re not authorized to speak publicly. The number of flights will be increased by June 26 if there aren’t further outbreaks in either city, one of the people said. Hong Kong Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau will hold a briefing on the bubble at 11:30 a.m. local time Monday, the government said in a statement.   Hong Kong and Singapore have been working on the creation of a travel corridor for months after plans for a November start were shelved due to a virus flareup in the Chinese territory. A plan to announce its revival last week was also canceled at the last minute by the Singapore side, people familiar with the matter said at the time. The Hong Kong government said a discussion with Singapore on the re-launch “is at an advance stage and the government will make announcement as soon as practicable.” Singapore’s transport ministry referred Bloomberg News to its most recent press release on the matter. Singapore last week said the two cities had not fixed a date to announce the resumption of the bubble, but “will do so once we are ready, hopefully very soon.” While Covid-19 cases in the two places pale in comparison to many countries, strict requirements for the bubble to open meant outbreaks that would be regarded as small elsewhere were enough to halt progress. Virus flareups in Hong Kong were the main reason for the months of delays. Now, after stemming a March outbreak centered on a gym, Hong Kong has been reporting only a handful of new infections a day, or low double-digits at most. Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on April 12 that the virus was “obviously contained” in the city and encouraged more people to get vaccinated, dangling the prospect of looser rules on social distancing for those who were inoculated. Singapore averaged two new cases per week recently. Sporadic outbreaks also complicated a travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand. After many months in the making, a quarantine-free flight corridor between those two countries -- which have largely eliminated the virus due to strict border curbs -- opened on April 19. The Hong Kong-Singapore agreement should unleash a torrent of pent-up demand from people eager to fly overseas and potentially do business in person after more than a year of the pandemic, though it is unclear yet the limited number of flights or seats that will be made available. The desire to travel in any way possible is reflected in the popularity of so-called cruises to nowhere in Singapore and tickets selling out for gimmicky dinners on parked aircraft. Under previous travel bubble plans, flights will be operated by Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. The two airlines have been hammered by Covid-19 as they don’t have domestic markets to compensate for a near-total collapse in international travel. Latest data show Cathay flew just 598 passengers a day on average in March as it operated a skeleton schedule to only 18 destinations. Singapore Airlines’ numbers are also just a tiny fraction of pre-pandemic levels. Cathay’s shares rose as much as 4.8% Monday morning, while Singapore Airlines advanced about 1%. "

Average fares for travel to the Mediterranean countries this summer are a maximum of 11% lower than in 2019, based on data for the first three days of this week, with steeper discounts available to Portugal, Italy and Turkey, according to analysis published Friday by flight search engine Skyscanner. The rush to book, unleashed after Britain unveiled plans to allow travel to resume as early as May 17, could lead to an increase in fares, depending on the pace at which airlines add seats and routes. Discount carrier EasyJet Plc and the U.K. arm of tour operator TUI AG both reported a jump in holiday sales of at least 500% following Monday’s announcement. “We may see some price increases as demand returns,” said Hugh Aitken, Skyscanner’s vice president for flights. “We expect prices to evolve as more clearer paths to recovery are charted out and network planners build in capacity and schedules to allow airlines to fly at scale.” Spain has emerged as the top destination for bookings from the U.K., where vaccination levels are ahead of the rest of Europe, along with Greece, whose tourism minister has said Britons who have had the jab should be able to enter this summer without Covid-19 tests. Bigger discounts on fares remain available to Italy and Turkey as well as Portugal, the only European country from which passengers arriving in Britain are required to quarantine in a hotel at their own cost.

Deutsche Lufthansa AG will deploy 364-seat Boeing Co. 747-8s on two-hour trips from Frankfurt after looser coronavirus curbs spurred bookings 25-fold since April, it said Friday. The jet will ply the route for four straight Saturdays starting July 17, with an Airbus SE A350 wide-body flying from Munich. Lufthansa’s 747s typically carry travelers to far-flung destinations like Tokyo and Los Angeles, leaving smaller aircraft like the Airbus A321, fitted out to carry 215 people, to ferry Germans to Mediterranean holiday destinations. It’s not the first time giant planes have been drafted onto shorter routes, with Air France using Airbus A380s to shuttle 500 people between Paris and London in 2010 and Gulf giant Emirates deploying the superjumbo on 40-minute hops between Dubai and Oman before the pandemic. British Airways has also looked at serving Greece with its biggest planes should U.K. restrictions be eased. While carriers including BA and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. retired their 747s when the virus hit, focusing on two-engine models, it’s not clear how long Lufthansa will continue to operate jet dubbed Queen of the Skies. The carrier removed older 747-400s and most A380s but kept the upgraded 747-8s -- of which it’s the No. 1 passenger operator -- some of them only six years old."

Just a few months ago, Britain was the envy of continental Europeans. A rapid vaccination push opened a path to reopen the U.K. economy, from shops to restaurants to international travel. The European Union, by contrast, looked stuck in inoculation bureaucracy and endless Covid-19 lockdowns. Now the tables are turning, with the government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the defensive following a sudden policy U-turn on travel that caught many U.K. vacationers off guard. On the other side of the channel, holiday bookings from Germany to France to Spain are gathering pace, in line with a vaccination drive covering a growing part of the population and depressing infections. Locals and tourists in the old town of Chania, on the island of Crete, on May 13. This week, France said it would allow vaccinated travelers from the EU to enter without showing negative Covid-19 tests starting June 9. All member states will accept visitors who hold so-called Covid-19 certificates from July 1. Dubbed the EU Digital Covid Certificate, it will be issued free of charge in digital or paper format, and certify their holders have been inoculated against the coronavirus, recovered from the illness or tested negative. Package holiday firm TUI AG is offering discounts of as much as 52% on last minute getaways to Mallorca and the Canary Islands, while U.K. discount carrier EasyJet Plc said it would gear up its European fleet even as the ever-changing rules in its home market makes it impossible to plan. EU countries already have latitude to start allowing in visitors from outside the bloc, including the all-important American contingent. Italy was among the first European nations to reopen, allowing passengers from EU countries, the U.K. and Israel to skip quarantine if they’ve had a negative Covid test, according to the health ministry. Greece, with its tourism-dependent economy, allowed tourists from some countries without a quarantine from April. In May, TUI -- which draws on German and British clientele -- said it stood by its plans to offer 75% of its 2019 capacity in the peak months of July through September. Even as the U.K. left Spain off its green list, Germans are already able to vacation in the country after the lifting of a general travel ban, and TUI Cruises had resumed operations. Air France-KLM and Deutsche Lufthansa AG both forecast an improvement over the summer. Air France-KLM has said its group capacity during the season would be as much as 65% of 2019 levels, while Lufthansa has added European destinations and seen bookings on some routes to Spain surge past 2019 levels. The loosening of border restrictions by French authorities covers vaccinated EU visitors and forgoes a quarantine requirement for inoculated British and American arrivals. “This is excellent news that will allow the French to go on vacation and see their relatives and for some tourists to visit our country,” Air France CEO Anne Rigail tweeted following the announcement Friday. The U.K. wants to lift domestic coronavirus restrictions on June 21, but Covid cases have been on the rise again, fueled by the highly transmissible Delta variant first identified in India which is now dominant in Britain. For Johnson, himself a coronavirus survivor, his decision comes down to balancing the pandemic toll taken on industry, people’s mental health and job opportunities, against the risk of a fresh spike in cases. Executives in the U.K. have made clear on which side they stand. Furious airline bosses have written to the government demanding answers about the methodology of the Portugal move, while not adding any more countries to the list. Listen: On The Beach CEO Simon Cooper discusses the impact of U.K. travel restrictions with Bloomberg Radio's Caroline Hepker and Roger Hearing. “The decision was both a shock and severe blow to the U.K. aviation industry and the traveling public,” says the June 4 letter, which was addressed to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. “Decisions on country allocation remain clouded in mystery, making it impossible for airlines and our customers to plan.” The U.K.’s surprise decision on June 3 to remove Portugal from a small list of countries where travel had been relatively easy forced tourists to seek a rapid retreat or face lengthy quarantines and more tests upon re-entry. The abrupt move echoes the disruption that took hold last summer, when sudden changes to quarantine rules forced vacationers to rush home at short notice. It’s forced airlines to readjust once again after pouring more resources into the Portuguese market when that country opened up a few weeks ago. “Boris Johnson’s government is again mismanaging the Covid recovery,” said Michael O’Leary, the chief executive officer of discount specialist Ryanair Holdings Plc. “This stop-go-stop approach to short haul travel in Europe is inexplicable and unjustified when 75% of the U.K. population has now received a Covid vaccine.” For Brits stuck in Portugal, carriers are putting on extra flights to help them return home. Both British Airways and EasyJet said they will be operating more flights and using larger aircraft to ensure passengers can get back to the U.K. before the Tuesday deadline. While the latest twist is sure to deter many Brits from planning holidays abroad, bookings from Germany, Italy, Spain and France for beach vacations have been steadily rising and are now up about 52% in the past month, according to travel comparison website Skyscanner. Popular destinations include Palma, Ibiza, Barcelona, Tenerife and Crete."

Pfizer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson officials on Thursday balked at calls from the global community to waive patent rights in favor of broader immunization. Intellectual property rights are critical to ensuring that Covid-19 vaccines can be deployed around the world, said Pfizer’s chief patent counsel, Bryan Zielinski. “It would never come out right,” said J&J chief intellectual property counsel Robert DeBerardine. “It wouldn’t taste like Grandma’s cookies.” U.S. President Joe Biden is facing calls from some lawmakers to back a proposal before the World Trade Organization that seeks a broad waiver of rules on intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines. The University of California and California State University systems are proposing a policy to have students, faculty and staff vaccinated before they return in the fall. Cal State Chancellor Joseph I. Castro called it “the most comprehensive and consequential university plan for Covid-19 vaccines” in the U.S. The university systems comprise more than 1 million students and employees across 33 major campuses. Students walk on the campus of University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in Los Angeles. Under the plan, students heading to UC and CSU campuses in the fall will need to update their immunization records on file. Exemptions are granted for medical reasons, according to statements from both school systems. Canada imposed a 30-day ban on direct flights from India and Pakistan as of 11:30 p.m. Thursday in Ottawa. Some Canadian provinces have found cases of a virus variant detected in India, which reported almost 315,000 new infections on Thursday. Leaders of Ontario and Quebec, Canada’s most populous provinces, have asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to further tighten restrictions for international travelers arriving by air or land.

Portland, Oregon, and Charlotte, North Carolina, led a list of large U.S. metro areas with increasing Covid-19 burdens in the week through Tuesday, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Portland’s cases rose by 24% compared to the previous seven-day period, Charlotte’s increased by 18% and Denver reported 13% more cases, the CDC said in a regular update. Jacksonville, Florida, and Seattle had the next-highest increases. Miami leads the list of 10 metro areas in cases relative to population, though it recorded a 5% drop in new infections for the period. The head of the World Health Organization called on governments and companies that “control the global supply” to share doses and know-how to increase equitable vaccine distribution. “Scarcity drives inequity and puts the global recovery at risk,” WHO director general Tedros Ghebreyesus said in a New York Times op-ed. Even with almost 1 billion doses administered, many countries face a crisis of high Covid-19 transmission and intensive care units overflowing with patients and running short on essential supplies such as oxygen, he said. Having made its way through those who lined up eagerly to get vaccinated for Covid-19, the campaign to inoculate every American is slowing with surplus supply and open appointments appearing in pockets nationwide. Daily vaccinations have declined to 3 million from a peak of 3.4 million -- and only 75% of about 28 million doses being shipped out weekly will be used at the current pace. The trend suggests that the effort is evolving from megasites that inoculated thousands a day to a slower grind designed to reach the half of Americans who haven’t yet received a dose. Israel and Bahrain have reached an agreement for the mutual recognition of vaccine passports for quarantine-free travel between the two countries, NPR correspondent Daniel Estrin said on Twitter, citing Israeli Foreign Ministry officials. Israel is in talks with the U.S., U.K. and other countries for similar arrangements. The U.S. Senate voted 94-1 in favor of legislation to combat hate crimes in the U.S., as lawmakers united to respond after an increase in attacks against Asian-Americans since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.

China’s Baiyun International airport in Guangzhou topped the list of the world’s busiest hubs in a coronavirus-wracked 2020, knocking Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International off a perch it occupied for more than two decades. Baiyun moved up from 11th place, trade group Airports Council International said in a statement, capping a year when the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted global air travel. Hartsfield-Jackson slipped to second place, as hubs in six Chinese cities joined Beijing Capital International in the top 10 based on passenger traffic. The Biden administration is weighing an appeal from progressive Democrats to accelerate global access to Covid-19 vaccines by supporting a waiver of intellectual-property protections, a move opposed by big drugmakers. Lawmakers led by senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren last week called on Biden to back a proposal before the WTO that seeks a broad waiver from obligations on the protection of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights and trade secrets. Intel Corp., the world’s largest chipmaker, said 70 people working for a construction contractor at an expansion of the company’s manufacturing plant in Ireland have contracted Covid-19. The chipmaker said Thursday that it was told about the outbreak last weekend. Intel’s plant is in Leixlip, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) west of the center of Dublin. Indonesia and Malaysia will limit travel toward the end of the month-long fasting period which typically sees more than 81 million people head home to regional towns from urban centers. The restrictions are aimed at avoiding a resurgence in cases similar to those playing out in other developing countries, which are threatening overall global growth. India set a daily record for cases this week, while infections are also rising in Turkey, Argentina and Brazil. Prime Minister Jean Castex said France will begin a “cautious” reopening in mid-May, preceded by a gradual easing of domestic travel curbs starting May 3. “The peak of the third wave seems to be behind us,” Castex told reporters. The timeline is conditional and not all venues will reopen at once, he said. A 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew, which Castex has called “effective,” wouldn’t be the first measure to be lifted. France also said travelers from Brazil, India, Chile, South Africa and Argentina would be subject to quarantine to prevent the import of variants. Meanwhile Italy will loosen many restrictions on Monday, Greece will follow in early May and Germany is considering privileges for people who have been immunized. Covid-19 survivors had a 59% increased risk of dying within six months after contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus, researchers reported in Nature. That works out to about eight extra deaths per 1,000 patients, worsening the pandemic’s hidden toll as many patients require readmission -- and some die -- weeks after the viral infection abates. One of the largest studies of Covid-19 “long haulers” proved what many doctors suspected: Not only are many patients suffering a raft of health problems six months after infection, they’re also at significantly greater risk of dying. New York on Thursday surpassed 2 million Covid-19 cases since the start of the pandemic. The state is third behind Texas, with 2.9 million, and California with more than 3.7 million reported cases, according to Bloomberg data. New York state recorded the biggest numbers of infections in mid-January, peaking on Jan. 14 with 19,942 positive tests.

(Source: ABC/Bloomberg) Deutsche Bank AG is weighing a new policy that would allow most employees to permanently work from home two days a week as the lender draws lessons from the coronavirus pandemic. The coronavirus picked up random alterations to its genetic sequence as it swept across the world, the New York Times reported. One mutation early on made a difference, multiple new findings suggest, helping the virus spread more easily and making the pandemic harder to stop, the newspaper said. The mutation, known as 614G, was first spotted in eastern China in January and then spread quickly throughout Europe and New York City, according to the report. President Vladimir Putin told fellow world leaders last week that both of Russia’s Covid-19 vaccines, including one he championed as the world’s first inoculation against the disease, are safe and effective. That doesn’t mean he’s taken a jab. “We have not yet begun widespread vaccination and the head of state can’t take part in vaccination as a volunteer. It’s impossible,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday, in response to a question on whether Putin had been inoculated. “The president can’t use an uncertified vaccine.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed an advance purchase agreement with Moderna Inc. for 160 million doses of the company’s vaccine in development. The agreement on behalf of all 27 EU countries marks the commission’s sixth such accord with drug companies. The EU’s executive arm is working on one more deal with a pharmaceutical company, the president said in a statement. Record airline losses from the coronavirus outbreak will balloon further next year as anticipated vaccination programs take time to revive travel demand, according to the industry’s main trade group. The International Air Transport Association on Tuesday predicted carriers will lose almost $39 billion in 2021, more than double the forecast in June. That’s on top of a $118.5 billion deficit in the current 12 months, up 40% from the prior outlook after a new wave of lockdowns wiped out a resurgence in flights.

California’s top public health official warned that the daily number of Covid-19 deaths in the state could top previous highs by Christmas, as a third wave of infections gathers momentum. The number of Californians hospitalized with the virus has more than doubled since the start of November, jumping from 2,537 to 5,844, said Mark Ghaly, the state’s Health and Human Services secretary. Infections have been accelerating, with a near-record 15,329 new cases reported Tuesday, and about 12% of newly infected people will likely be hospitalized in the next two to three weeks, he said. Deaths, which briefly topped 200 per day in late July, could rise to new highs, Ghaly said. “The idea that the numbers of deaths could exceed where we’ve been before is also indeed real and true,” Ghaly said Tuesday during a press conference. But that could depend on how people respond to the surge. “The models have been proven wrong before, because Californians come together to prove them wrong,” he said. The most-populous state has recorded more than 18,700 deaths, behind only New York and Texas. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is proposing a further tightening of the country’s coronavirus restrictions, setting the stage for another tense round of discussions with the country’s 16 state leaders who have called for more lenient measures. Merkel will talk to regional premiers on Wednesday to agree on an extension of the country’s partial shutdown until at least Dec. 20. In a briefing paper from the Chancellery obtained by Bloomberg, she suggests to further restrict the number of customers allowed into shops and for additional measures in schools located in infection hotspots. French President Emmanuel Macron said he will gradually lift a nationwide lockdown from Saturday an outbreak eases. Small stores will be permitted to open from Nov. 28 with extra rules, after weeks of shopkeepers criticizing and mocking the government’s decision to ban retail it deemed non-essential. Restaurants will remain closed, however, until at least Jan. 20, depriving the sector of the income from one of the busiest periods of the year.“We have put the brake on the circulation of the virus,” Macron said in a televised address Tuesday. “But a few weeks are still needed to reach our targets” of 5,000 cases a day and up to 3,000 people in intensive care. The number of French virus patients in intensive-care units fell by 165 to 4,289 on Tuesday, the biggest daily drop since May 12. Overall hospitalizations continued to decline and are now back to the level of more than two weeks ago. The number of Covid-19 deaths in Colorado could more than double to 6,600 by the end of the year unless the current outbreak is contained, state epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy said at a news conference in Denver. An estimated 1-in-41 state residents are contagious, the most since tracking began, Governor Jared Polis said. Addressing local officials reluctant to follow stricter state health orders, Polis asked: “Are you on the side of the virus or are you on the side of Colorado?” Separately, 551 of 993 inmates at a major Colorado prison, the Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility, are infected, the Colorado Springs Gazette reported. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards cut the number of customers allowed at restaurants, gyms, salons, casinos, malls and other nonessential businesses from 75% of their occupancy rate to 50%, the Associated Press reported. Crowds at churches will be capped at 75% of their capacity, with distancing among people of different households required. The state is seeing a spike in hospitalizations. Federal health officials are working on new guidance that would shorten the recommended 14-day quarantine period following a potential exposure to the coronavirus, the top U.S. virus-testing official said on Tuesday. Officials are beginning to see a preponderance of evidence that people could spend less time in quarantine if they also test negative for Covid-19, said Admiral Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, on a call with reporters. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Tuesday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is finalizing recommendations for a new quarantine period of seven and 10 days, and which would include a negative test. The Texas Division Of Emergency Management has established a Covid-19 antibody-infusion site at a state-run treatment center in El Paso, Governor Greg Abbott said in a statement. Federal officials stocked the outpatient site with 1,000 doses of bamlanivimab, a coronavirus antibody therapy made by Eli Lilly & Co. that was approved by the U.S. for emergency use this month. Viewed as a treatment to prevent hospitalizations, the doses are being reserved for people who tested positive and have an increased risk of developing severe symptoms. El Paso continues to struggle with one of the worst outbreaks in Texas. Infections have jumped 63% since the beginning of the month, figures from the Texas Department of State Health Services show. The deadly disease has infected 81,511 people and claimed 980 lives in El Paso County since March, state figures show. Ireland reported the fewest new coronavirus cases in two months, ahead of a easing of current restrictions. There were 226 newly diagnosed cases on Tuesday, the health ministry said, the least since Sept. 21. The government is expected to decide on loosening the current lockdown later this week, with restrictions due to expire on Dec. 1. Ireland also formally introduced fines for breaches of coronavirus rules Tuesday, including for not wearing masks and for hosting or attending house parties. New York state is headed toward a major surge in coronavirus cases, at least a 20% increase over the holiday season, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday. At the low end, experts say the state could see a 20% increase in cases between now and January, with the positive test rate reaching 12.46%, Cuomo said at a virus briefing on Long Island. If the state sees more, emergency hospital beds would be needed, he said. “That’s a problem,” Cuomo said, urging New Yorkers to “be smart” and keep guests to a maximum of 10 people this Thanksgiving. “It’s hard, but sometimes hard is smart.” The testing positivity rate statewide was 2.93% on Monday, with 2,856 hospitalizations, Cuomo said. New Jersey reported 48 deaths with a lab-confirmed link to the virus, the highest such figure since June 5. For much of July, August, September and October, the state had reported fewer than 10 deaths each day. The new data push the state’s known Covid-19 deaths to above 15,000, while another 1,812 fatalities had an untested but probable link. “We are in the thick of the Covid second wave,” Governor Phil Murphy said during a bill-signing. He pleaded with New Jerseyans to limit Thursday’s Thanksgiving guests to immediate family and to exclude the most vulnerable: “This is not the year to have grandma and grandpa over.” Italy reported the highest number of coronavirus fatalities since the height of the pandemic in the spring, even as data on new contagions hinted that the outbreak is slowing down. Daily deaths climbed to 853 Tuesday, the most since March 28 and up from 630 a day earlier. New cases fell 28% from a week earlier to 23,232, with a test positivity rate falling to 12.3%, the lowest in a month. “There is an initial but clear decline in positivity,” said Franco Locatelli, head of Italy’s public health institute, at a press conference. Deaths will only start declining later, he added. Hospitalized patients fell for the first time in two months, dropping by 114 to 38,393. The U.K. recorded its lowest number of new coronavirus cases in nearly two months on Tuesday, the latest indication that infections are steadily declining. Restrictions in England are due to be eased next week to make way for a regional approach that will allow many businesses to reopen, and some socializing. A further 11,299 new cases were reported, the fewest since Oct. 2 and down from a peak of more than 33,000 on Nov. 12. Some 608 new deaths from coronavirus were reported, which is about level week on week, but it is also the highest daily increase since cases spiked for the second time. New York City will have vehicle checkpoints at key bridges and crossings, and will strictly enforce the travel quarantine, Sheriff Joseph Fucito said. The sheriff’s office will conduct spot checks when out-of-state buses drop riders off at the curb. Test and tracing teams will be on the ground to direct individuals to testing sites and provide education on quarantine, Fucito said. The 14-day quarantine mandates that travelers quarantine or test out. Violations of self-quarantine will be enforced and may carry fines of $1,000 to $2,000, according to the mayor’s office. The city will enforce the completion of traveler forms at airports, Penn Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal. There will be self-test site teams on the premises. New York, the early center of the U.S. outbreak, reported a seven-day average of 1,476 new cases, and a seven-day positive test rate of 3.17%, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio. South Africa has paid 500 million rand ($33 million) to the Covax program, which strives to supply low- and middle-income countries with proven Covid-19 vaccines to ensure equitable access around the world, according to Finance Minister Tito Mboweni. Mboweni said he will find a further 4.5 billion rand from the budget to make sure South Africa has an adequate supply and is at “the front of the queue” when vaccines become available. There may also be scope to help some neighbors, he said. The global Covax alliance has raised more than $2 billion and secured deals for roughly 700 million doses so far. London should be placed on the second tier of coronavirus restrictions when England’s national lockdown ends next week, Mayor Sadiq Khan said in a tweet. Many bars, businesses, restaurants clubs and cultural venues might not recover if they were forced to close under the highest level of measures, he said.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Pelosi in a 40-minute call that President Donald Trump wants agreement on a comprehensive stimulus package, according to Drew Hammill, a Pelosi spokesman. Nancy Pelosi at the Russell Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 8. Meanwhile, White House spokeswoman Alyssa Farah said, “we’ve made very clear we want a skinny package,” though she later clarified that position, telling reporters the administration is “open to going with something bigger.” She reiterated opposition to the $2.2 trillion plan from House Democrats. Prospects for coming to an agreement have proved volatile since Trump pulled his negotiators out of talks on a comprehensive package on Tuesday. Stocks, too, have proved volatile, with airline shares rising and falling on shifting indications of the potential for a separate aid package for the industry. The broader S&P 500 Index climbed for a second session Thursday, after a tumble Tuesday, when Trump pulled his negotiators from stimulus talks. Pelosi sent a letter to House Democrats Friday morning casting further doubt on negotiations. “The Administration does not share this priority of crushing the virus. The President does not have the capacity, leadership or plan for testing, tracing, and isolation that is needed,” Pelosi wrote. “Instead, Trump’s delay, denial, distortion of reality and disdain for science has exacted a deadly and preventable human toll. Mnuchin and Pelosi held a follow-up call Thursday afternoon with House Small Business Committee Chairwoman Nydia Velasquez and Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters about small businesses and access to capital. The negotiations are proceeding against a frenzied backdrop, with the president recuperating from Covid-19 and the final stretch of the election campaign under way. Pelosi and Trump publicly questioned each other’s ability to perform their jobs on Thursday. Read More: Pelosi and Trump Question Each Other’s Mental Faculties The House speaker said earlier Thursday there could be no action on a stand-alone bill to aid airlines or any other sector of the economy without an agreement with the White House and Republicans on a broader stimulus package. Pelosi said airline aid could move through Congress before a comprehensive deal is voted on -- but that would have to be advanced in the “context” of a broader bill. “I have made the case to my colleagues that this is a special case,” Pelosi said on Bloomberg TV. “There is no stand-alone bill without a bigger bill,” she said. Pelosi has also said this week she is pressing for language that would limit Trump’s ability to divert virus testing and treatment funds to other projects. “I’m always optimistic,” Pelosi said. “Maybe the president seeing the reaction to his walking away from the table is the opportunity that we have for them to come back to the table for us to get an agreement -- and the sooner the better.” Trump changed course soon after his Tuesday tweet that ordered an end to talks until after he wins the election, blaming Pelosi for not negotiating in good faith. That move baffled Trump’s allies and created the political risk he’d be blamed entirely for the economic fallout. On Thursday, he told Fox Business that talks on a stimulus plan are now “starting to work out.” Trump on Thursday claimed that multiple separate measures, including $1,200 individual checks, are on the table. “We started talking again. And we’re talking about airlines and we’re talking about a bigger deal than airlines,” Trump said in the Fox Business interview. “We’re talking about a deal with $1,200 per person, we’re talking about other things.” Speaking later in Kentucky, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the two sides should continue to try to negotiate a deal, but there are “vast differences about how much we should spend.” “The speaker insists on an outrageous amount of money” McConnell said, adding that there are members of his GOP majority that think enough has been done already. “Hopefully there will be a way forward soon.” The comments marked a shift for McConnell, who earlier this week said he supported Trump’s decision to call off talks. The Democratic plan calls for $2.2 trillion in spending, while Mnuchin has offered $1.6 trillion. The administration’s figure is higher than what many Senate Republicans have said they could support. Even if there were a breakthrough in Pelosi’s talks with Mnuchin, negotiations among House Democrats and the Senate’s calendar make it unlikely that a comprehensive stimulus package or a stand-alone bill to help airlines -- which are already hemorrhaging tens of thousands of jobs -- will reach the president’s desk before the end of October. While a measure could pass quickly if no lawmaker in either chamber objects, that’s unlikely to happen. Two Republican senators, Pat Toomey and Mike Lee, said in a statement Thursday that they oppose a bailout for the airline industry without some protections for taxpayers and the ability to make changes to the legislation. Without additional aid, American Airlines Group Inc. will cut more flights in addition to jobs, said Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker. The carrier began implementing 19,000 layoffs last week. “There will absolutely be discontinuation of service to small communities and there will be much less service to larger communities,” Parker said Thursday in an interview with CNBC. — With assistance by Saleha Mohsin, Josh Wingrove, Billy House, Cecile Gutscher, Claire Ballentine, David Westin, Steven T.

IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., approved a proposal to raise funds selling shares to large investors, the airline said in an exchange filing Monday. The move comes a few months after it said it didn’t need money. In January, IndiGo shelved plans to raise as much as 40 billion rupees with then Chief Financial Officer Aditya Pande saying the company’s internal sources of cash would be sufficient on the back of a recovery in demand. That was before a vicious second wave of virus cases erupted in Ind, killing thousands of people. Pande resigned in February and has been replaced by Jiten Chopra. India’s rapidly rising Covid-19 caseload has disappointed the country’s air travel industry, which had just begun to show signs of recovery, particularly in domestic routes. Airlines in the South Asian nation lost $2 billion in nine months last year. The second wave has delayed a recovery by around six months for international travel and three for domestic, according to India Ratings & Research Ltd., a unit of Fitch Ratings Ltd. Moody’s Investors Service said last month that any revenue decline due to a fall in traffic will damp the already weak financial numbers for airports too, including Delhi International Airport Ltd. and GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd. IndiGo is burning about 150 million rupees of cash every day, Pande said on an earnings call in January. SpiceJet Ltd., India’s second-largest carrier, has deferred salaries for half of its employees, while Chairman Ajay Singh will forgo his salary entirely. The government in India has currently restricted airlines to operate at 80% capacity. The malaise has also seen aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co. and Airbus SE reset production targets as demand for new planes vanishes. IndiGo is the biggest customer of Airbus’s best-selling A320neo jets. IndiGo posted a wider-than-expected net loss of 6.3 billion rupees in January for the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a record deficit of 12 billion rupees in the second quarter. Revenue for the period slumped 51% year-on-year, while total cash stood at 183.7 billion rupees. At the time, CEO Ronojoy Dutta said IndiGo was looking forward to a “gradual opening up of international scheduled flights because increased capacity and aircraft utilization are so very critical for our return to profitability.”"

Delta now makes up 83% of all sequenced cases in the U.S., up from 50% in early July, health authorities said. A spokesman for U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisted that the country’s self-isolation rules aren’t optional following some mixed messaging from a government minister.

The number of hospitalizations has gone up in recent days, though at a slower pace than infections. Official figures showed 50 new admissions on Monday, the biggest daily increase since May 10. The Dutch government has reintroduced some restrictions, including limiting opening hours for bars, while a recommendation for people to work from home if possible was reinstated from Monday. Indonesia may start to gradually ease nationwide emergency curbs if cases and levels of hospital occupancy decline. The government may relax the restrictions starting July 26 if cases continue to fall, according to President Joko Widodo. This will include allowing some eateries and shops to stay open for longer, Jokowi, as the president is known, said in a televised address on Tuesday.

Indonesia is speeding up vaccination to reach herd immunity as the highly infectious delta variant of the coronavirus continued to tear through the country. Mauritius recorded a record daily number of cases after outbreaks among vaccinated foreign factory workers living in hostels, according to the Health Ministry. The Indian Ocean island nation, which reopened its borders to tourists last week, added 368 new infections on Monday, with 305 of them being factory workers and almost all asymptomatic. Foreign labor in the country’s export-oriented manufacturing industry accounts for 47% of total employment. Mauritius is seeking to revive its tourism industry after ramping up vaccinations, and about a third of its 1.3 million people are fully inoculated. France’s vaccination rollout is accelerating after President Emmanuel Macron announced that “health passes” — showing proof of testing or immunization — will be required in restaurants and cafes. A Health Ministry official said at a briefing that 4.3 million injections were administered last week, including 1.7 million first doses. In another record, 880,000 shots were administered on Friday. And this week saw the best Monday of the rollout, the official said. French vaccinations are proceeding twice as much fast as the rollouts in Italy and Germany, the official said. After Macron’s speech, the number of online vaccine appointments climbed to 520,000 daily from 140,000 daily in early July. France will reach its target of 40 million first doses ahead of schedule, the official said. The U.K. government insisted people told to isolate by the National Health Service contact-tracing mobile app can’t ignore the advice. Earlier, a minister had said it was “optional” and not legally binding. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Press Association that “isolation remains the most important action people can take to stop the spread of the virus.” The mixed messaging came after Business Minister Paul Scully told Times Radio on Tuesday “it is up to individuals and employers” whether they isolate after being “pinged.” Iran reported a record number of new cases, with 27,444 in the past 24 hours. The country also posted its highest daily death toll in two months, at 250. The latest figures bring Iran’s total infections to more than 3.5 million and its fatalities to 87,624. About 2% of the population has been fully vaccinated, according to Health Ministry data. Hong Kong and Singapore agreed to conduct a review in late August on whether to implement a quarantine-free air travel bubble, the Hong Kong government said on its website. The condition for launching the bubble couldn’t be met for the time being given the recent surge of confirmed cases in Singapore. With just three days left until the Tokyo Olympics, the Japanese capital’s cases continue to rise, with 1,387 confirmed on Tuesday, up from 830 a week earlier. The seven-day average, at 1,180, has roughly doubled over the past two weeks. Infections among Olympics staff, athletes and others linked to the games are also increasing. Organizers say a total of 71 people have tested positive, including 31 who are among the tens of thousands of international visitors expected in Japan to compete or work at the Olympics. Meanwhile, more Japanese companies have decided against sending executives to Friday’s opening ceremony. France has seen a jump in vaccinations since President Emmanuel Macron announced that passes showing proof of testing or immunization will be required in restaurants and cafes. Apple Inc. is pushing back its return-to-office deadline because of the resurgence in cases across many countries. Tokyo’s infections continue to rise with just three days left until the Olympics, and more Japanese companies have decided against sending executives to Friday’s opening ceremony. A study found Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine is much less effective against the delta and lambda variants than against the original virus, the New York Times reported. The lab-based findings, which haven’t been peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal, suggest the need for a second dose for the 13 million people who have received the inoculation. The authors of the study recommended an mRNA vaccine made by Pfizer Inc.-Biontech SE or Moderna Inc. as the second shot. The results contrast those from smaller studies published by J&J earlier this month that suggested a single dose of its vaccine is effective against delta even eight months after inoculation, the Times said. Seema Kumar, a J&J spokeswoman, told the newspaper that the new data “do not speak to the full nature of immune protection.”  The new study is credible because the authors don’t have ties to any vaccine makers, John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York, told the Times. He cited several studies in monkeys and people that show that two doses of the J&J vaccine are more effective than just one. The data should prompt the Food and Drug Administration to reconsider its recommendation that fully vaccinated people don’t need booster shots, said Nathaniel Landau, a virologist at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, who led the study. A senior spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a White House official have tested positive for Covid-19. Both had been fully vaccinated and are among several staffers in Congress and at the White House who’ve been recently infected. The Pelosi staff member had no contact with the speaker since being exposed, Drew Hammill, a Pelosi spokesperson, said in a statement. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that contract tracing had determined that the infected staff there had no close contact with senior people or President Joe Biden. The delta variant now makes up 83% of all sequenced Covid-19 cases in the U.S., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said in a Senate hearing. The new figure is up from 50% from the week of July 3. She said areas of the country with limited vaccination coverage are allowing spread of the highly transmissible variant, which was first identified in India. “Each death is tragic and even more heartbreaking when we know that the majority of these deaths can be prevented with a simple, safe, available vaccine,” Walensky said. New York City’s vaccine administration rate has plunged to less than 15,000 a day, from more than 100,000 a day in mid-April, as cases increase. The city has fully vaccinated 4.5 million residents, data show, falling short of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s goal to have 5 million New Yorkers fully vaccinated by June. The city reported a seven-day average of 576 confirmed and probable cases on July 18, more than double the average on July 6. Hospitalizations have edged up just slightly. Almost all of those admitted for Covid-19 haven’t been vaccinated, according to Health Commissioner Dave Chokshi. “This is preventable suffering,” he said on Twitter.

Punitive measures such as taxation reduce resources that could support investments to cut emissions, the International Air Transport Association said, while Deutsche Lufthansa AG said the EU’s proposals will need additional measures to ensure a level playing field for carriers. The maritime industry warned the bloc’s plans will hinder talks on a global carbon levy. “The timescale of the change is unprecedented, as this shift has to happen within two-to-three model cycles. Opel, Volvo and Ford plan to sell only zero-emission cars, whereas Volkswagen and Stellantis have set ambitious EV sales targets for 2030. The proposal also puts plug-in hybrid technology at risk.” Click here to read the research. #FitFor55: EU auto industry’s initial reaction to Europe’s #climate plans ""The proposed #CO2 target for #cars of 55% by 2030 will be very challenging, and certainly requires corresponding binding #AFID targets.""PRESS RELEASE: https://t.co/EBoYS3VM65#RoadToCarbonNeutrality pic.twitter.com/SHWCTqAZqy The Commission is also proposing a new emissions trading system for the fuel supply industry for vehicles and heating, applied to suppliers. The EU’s moves haven’t come out of nowhere, and many carmakers have accelerated their EV shifts of late. Volkswagen AG, Europe’s biggest automaker and behind the industry’s biggest EV push, on Tuesday announced it wants to build a battery plant in Spain, the third out of six planned sites. VW’s closest competitor in the region, Stellantis NV, last week joined a slew of other major manufacturers with a 30 billion-euro ($35.4 billion) spending spree on EVs. Meeting the EU’s tougher targets will be “not at all easy,” Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess told Bloomberg Television. Scaling up battery production will be a “huge” challenge both for the industry and VW, he said. Aviation contributes about 4.5% of total EU emissions. Even before the pandemic brought air travel to its knees, the sector was in the crosshairs of lawmakers and the flight-shaming movement spurred on in part by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. Airlines will eventually have to pay for the pollution from their planes with a gradual phasing out of emission allowances. The EU says it’s concerned that without the curbs proposed, CO2 output will continue to grow, imperiling mid-century climate targets. The proposed measures include taxation on jet fuel for intra-European flights, mandatory carbon offsets as well as requirements for a gradual increase in sustainable aviation fuel blended in with kerosene. A 2% blend will be required starting in 2025, rising to 63% in 2050. An increasing portion will be synthetically made over the period. They’ll be exempt under the EU’s new energy taxation framework. “Taxes siphon money from the industry that could support emissions-reducing investments in fleet renewal and clean technologies,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general and the former head of British Airways’ parent IAG SA.  European aviation sector proposes EU Pact for Sustainable Aviation to realise EU’s 2030 and 2050 decarbonisation ambitions, complementing European Commission’s ‘Fit for 55’ policies announced today.Learn more: https://t.co/h4ciEIuzEC@A4Europe @CANSOEurope @ASDEurope @eraaorg pic.twitter.com/scaBBcImay While the industry welcomed some of the measures, airlines are set to fight hard behind the scenes to soften the blow and there’s risk of a resumption of wrangling with governments and carriers outside the European Union. “These measures will definitely raise the cost on airlines and eventually raise ticket prices,” said Laurent Donceel, a senior policy director at lobby group Airlines for Europe. A tax on kerosene won’t directly lead to a reduction in CO2 output, and may even lead to aircraft taking longer routes to circumvent the levy, Air France-KLM’s Dutch arm said. The EU’s proposed new rules will slowly push shipping, which emits as much carbon as Belgium in the region, away from oil and toward clean propellants like biofuels. The regulation comes in three parts. The sector will be included in the bloc’s carbon market for the first time. Separately, the FuelEU Maritime initiative aims to increase the use of alternative fuels, targeting a cut in emissions intensity of 2% by 2025 and increasing to 75% by 2050. This goal should get an additional push from plans to start taxing shipping fuel, while sustainable and alternative fuels will be exempt. ”It’s difficult to see what extending the EU ETS to shipping will achieve towards reducing CO2, particularly as the proposal only covers about 7.5% of shipping’s global emissions,” said Guy Platten, secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping that represents more than 80% of the world’s merchant fleet. “The industry’s overwhelming preference is for a global levy which will incentivize real emission reductions rather than red tape.” PRESS RELEASE: EU overreach with Emissions Trading System threatens to sink shipping’s decarbonisation efforts. Read more here:  https://t.co/uqVjC2JTmt #EUETS #shipping #decarbonisation pic.twitter.com/UvDtQNJqKD Both the FuelEU initiative and the carbon market will cover intra-EU traffic, plus half of the voyages for ships sailing into -- and out of -- the bloc. While the measures “will make things more expensive,” the impact on the cost of end products is likely to be relatively small, said Jan Dieleman, head of Cargill Inc.’s ocean transportation business. Using biofuels purchased by shippers from outside the EU to replace oil-derived marine fuel could prove tricky, because the bloc can’t enforce its sustainability criteria outside its borders, according to the European Community Shipowners’ Associations, which represents the continent’s shipping industry. The EU’s proposed rules may also force shipping’s global regulator, the International Maritime Organization, to step up efforts on decarbonization, or risk being sidelined by other authorities, like the EU. The UN body has been criticized for moving too slowly, while industry titans A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S and Trafigura Group have both called for a global carbon tax. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association welcomed mandatory targets for the ramp-up of charging infrastructure in all member states to reach “very challenging” targets to cut emissions. Key to the EU’s ambitious goal is the bid to cut emissions by 55% in 2030 compared to levels in 1990, up from a previous target for a 40% reduction. A transformational overhaul that will change how people drive and fly is at the core of hitting the goals to reduce pollution from transport, a sector that accounts for as much as a quarter of total emissions. To get there, the EU is, among a broad swathe of policy measures, seeking to phase out combustion-engine cars by requiring emissions from new cars and vans to fall by 55% from 2030 and to zero by 2035, and new taxes on aviation fuel. The Commission also wants maritime transport to become part of the EU’s carbon market, already the world’s biggest. Pollution from transportation has remained stubbornly high in the EU. While overall emissions fell by around a quarter since 1990, led by a halving in emissions from electricity production, greenhouse gases from transport rose by about a third, according to figures from the European Environment Agency. Industrial emissions fell around 36% over the period. The EU’s Fit for 55 package, which puts the region ahead of other major economies, is unlikely to be implemented exactly as proposed and years of political wrangling with member states will ensue. As late as this week, France resisted the EU’s plan to end sales of new combustion-engine cars to advocate for more lenient targets and a longer leash for plug-in hybrid vehicles. Here’s how each industry is reacting: While automakers are already deep into shifting to EVs, a 55% CO2 cut for average fleet emissions by 2030 is a significant step up from the previous target of a 37.5% reduction from 2021 levels. Earlier proposals has envisioned an even steeper drop of 65%. Thanks to generous incentives, Europe overtook China as the world’s largest market for plug-in hybrid and electric cars last year and EVs made up nearly 15% of deliveries during the first quarter. But much more is required, particularly sales of purely electric cars, which will have to account for between 60% to 70% of sales in 2030, according to Barclays. Such levels of EV sales has put charging infrastructure into sharp focus, especially for mass market buyers less likely to be able to plug in their vehicles at home. The EU plans to require member states to install charging points in line with EV sales and at regular intervals along highways of every 60 kilometers (37 miles) and every 150 kilometers for hydrogen refueling. This should deliver on a previous goal of 1 million public recharging points by 2025 and approximately 3.5 million by 2030, the EU said. “Without significantly increased efforts by all stakeholders -- including member states and all involved sectors -- the proposed target is simply not viable,” BMW Chief Executive Officer and ACEA President Oliver Zipse said."

Leaders gathering on the Cornish coast in southern England will discuss Covid, China and climate change, including a proposal to do away with polluting cars. The U.K. is seeking to project an image of rejuvenated status after leaving the European Union, though there are plenty of tensions over its post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland that could bubble over. Macron separately took a veiled jab at the U.S. for buying and keeping more vaccine doses than it needs, and said the G-7 must come up with clearer targets on vaccine donations. The French leader, who made a point to remind his audience that Europe has been at the forefront of tackling climate and health issues, called for countries to raise their targets for vaccine donations. Macron also said transparency is needed on the price of vaccines bought for poorer countries via initiatives like Covax, but cautioned that full pricing transparency would hurt pharmaceutical businesses. He praised the agreement of G-7 finance ministers on a global corporate tax rate, suggesting the accord could be implemented concretely around 2025 and could bring 5 to 10 billion euros to France. -- Ania Nussbaum Although his focus this weekend is on foreign affairs, Johnson will also be mulling a crucial decision on whether to lift the U.K.’s remaining pandemic restrictions. According to people familiar with the matter, the surge in cases of the delta variant makes an extension to the curbs on social gatherings more likely than not. Delaying the end of lockdown beyond Johnson’s target date of June 21 would be a blow for the British leader. With 78% of adults having received at least one vaccine shot, he faces demands from his own party to reopen the economy in full. -- Alex Morales Johnson greeted Biden at the Carbis Bay Hotel overlooking the Cornish seafront as the leaders seek to re-launch the U.K.-U.S. relationship at a time of friction over the fallout from Brexit. “Everybody’s absolutely thrilled to see you,” Johnson said as the pair posed for photos before heading into a private meeting. “I told the prime minister we have something in common. We both married way above our station,” Biden said. To which Johnson replied: “I’m not going to dissent from that one. I’m not going to disagree with you on that. Or indeed on anything else.” Airlines hit hard by Covid sought swifter moves to loosen restrictions on travel following pledges from the U.S. and the U.K. to reopen lucrative trans-Atlantic links. Carriers welcomed an agreement to create a joint task force to explore options for resuming travel, but are pushing for more than the tentative gesture. Vaccinated people ought to be able to travel, Luis Gallego, chief executive officer of British Airways parent IAG SA, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. Given progress with rolling out inoculations in both countries, “we don’t see why they have to have restrictions between the U.S. and the U.K.” -- Christopher Jasper Years of policy grievances and some personal history will hang over Monday’s first meeting between Biden and Erdogan in Brussels on the sidelines of the NATO summit, where their talks will focus on military matters. Erdogan plans to present Turkish deals to sell armed drones to Ukraine and Poland, and possibly Latvia, as aiding efforts to deter Russia, according to people familiar with the matter. He’ll offer to deepen collaboration on Syria and Libya, and stress Turkey’s role halting refugees heading to Europe. -- Selcan Hacaoglu and Firat Kozok The G-7 draft communique reflects a narrative of better collaboration to control Covid-19 and fight climate change, but also to tackle some trickier issues together, including Russia and China. The U.S. will pay about $3.5 billion -- a not-for-profit price -- for the 500 million vaccine doses it is purchasing to distribute to other countries, a senior Biden administration official said. The U.S. will use money already appropriated by Congress in the American Rescue Plan, including $2 billion that had been committed to Covax, and plans to begin shipping the doses in August, the official said. -- Joshua Gallu Under one proposal contained in a document seen by Bloomberg, G-7 governments would “strive” to ensure that the majority of all new passenger car sales are not petrol or diesel-powered “by 2030 or sooner.” But countries are divided on how specific the measures should be. The commitments have not yet been agreed to by G-7 officials who are drafting the conclusions of this weekend’s summit. But setting the goal for moving away from gasoline could represent a turning point in efforts to reduce global oil consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. -- Tim Ross It’s unclear if Merkel and Biden will meet one-on-one in Cornwall or have a bilateral sitdown in Brussels. A German official said the discussion on timing was fluid. But it could mean a brief chat at the G-7 and tackling trickier issues like the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline later. While the U.S. has called the pipeline project from Russia to Germany a fait accompli, and waived sanctions against both the operator and its chief executive officer, Biden could push Merkel to make sure Russian President Vladimir Putin sticks to understandings on the role of Ukraine as a transit country for gas. Merkel will also want to chat with Biden ahead of his summit with Putin later next week, to press the case for a common U.S.-Europe approach on Russia. -- Arne Delfs Environmental campaigners have said they need to see more than just warm words from leaders this weekend when it comes to climate finance. So far, only Canada appears to be planning to announce any fresh funding at the summit, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expected to announce an increase in climate finance, according to a person familiar with the matter. The draft communique also seeks a commitment from countries to “each” increase their climate finance. -- Jess Shankleman Read: G-7 Leaders Poised to Turn Spotlight on Green Finance at Summit Germany and its European partners welcome the renewed commitment by the U.S. to international alliances and multilateral cooperation, and are ready to work with Biden in the current “unusually challenging times,” according to a senior government official in Berlin. Merkel’s main message to her fellow leaders at her final G-7 summit will be that multilateralism is back and international partnerships are vital to successfully tackle problems like climate change and the pandemic, said the official, who asked not to be identified by name in line with briefing rules. Merkel had a famously difficult relationship with Donald Trump, who singled out Germany for all sorts of wrongs from not paying enough into NATO to attacking its car industry and announcing a pullout of troops stationed there. A famous G-7 picture in Canada, when Trump ripped up the communique officials had agreed on, shows Merkel standing over Trump. Even with the former president out of office, Merkel has said the post-war order is over. The first meeting for Biden and Johnson, which was scheduled to be held in a picturesque castle on an island off the southern British coast, has been moved to the mainland after dreary weather forced a change in plans. Britain had been hoping to showcase St. Michael’s Mount and its ancient castle that houses a piece of Napoleon’s coat that he wore at the Battle of Waterloo. Instead, the meeting will be held at Carbis Bay, the site of the G-7 summit, according to White House officials. -- Jennifer Jacobs The G-7 meeting will endorse the recent landmark deal to impose a 15% minimum global corporate tax rate, with the clear understanding there are more hoops to go through before it becomes a reality. The draft communique is expected to say that “we have taken a significant step forward in creating a fairer tax system fit for the 21st century, and reversed a 40-year race to the bottom.” Read our story on how this will impact the world’s richest.  Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Commission, said plans for a levy on the largest online companies and on “the 100 most wealthy, most successful companies” don’t conflict, and that “they are more complementary because in the development of our digital levy we are making sure that this is non-discriminatory and that there will be no double taxation.” The draft also touches on the issue of countries getting their deficits and debt in order down the line, be it with tax increases or spending cuts: “Once the recovery is firmly established, we need to ensure the long-term sustainability of public finances.” -- Flavia Krause-Jackson Charles Michel, head of the European Council, told reporters the EU will use all tools available to defend the bloc’s interests in the clash over trade with Northern Ireland. “It is fundamental, it is paramount to implement what we have decided. This is a question of rule of law which is an important value that we share in common,” Michel told reporters in Brussels, when asked what his message will be for Johnson at the G-7. “We will use all the tools we have in order to make sure we defend our interests, and we protect the integrity of the single market and that we guarantee the level playing field,” Michel said. -- John Follain Key Developments: Big Read: Attending Her Last G-7, Merkel Has Had Enough of U.S. Leadership All times are local (BST). German Chancellor Angela Merkel is still planning to attend the G-7 summit despite a Covid outbreak at a hotel in St. Ives, according to the British government.  Johnson’s spokesman Max Blain told reporters that Merkel was still due to arrive. Merkel has received her first Covid vaccine shot, but is awaiting her second to be fully vaccinated. According to local media, one of the hotels in the town where reporters and delegates are staying has been shut due to staff contracting Covid-19. -- Tim Ross Speaking to broadcasters after their meeting, Johnson insisted Biden hadn’t pushed him to fix relations with the EU, which have soured since Brexit. Instead, the pair had “great” talks that went on “for a long time,” the British leader said. The conversations with with Biden’s team were “fantastic” and “a breath of fresh air” because they want to do a lot of work together, he added. -- Tim Ross Biden in turn said he and Johnson had a “very productive meeting” where they revitalized their commitment to work on challenges such as cybersecurity, health and climate. “We discussed our common goals for driving ambitious global action” on the climate crisis, Biden said in remarks at Tregenna Castle in St. Ives. He said they also discussed their efforts to coordinate a withdrawal from Afghanistan. -- Jennifer Jacobs In a press conference in Paris ahead of his trip to Cornwall, French President Emmanuel Macron said he will meet with Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan before the NATO summit in Brussels on Monday to discuss the role of NATO members, issues including Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh, and to explain his recent statements regarding Islam in France. The point, Macron also said, will be to review potential cooperation on new topics.

The investment amounts to $35 million, Heart Chief Executive Officer Anders Forslund said in an interview before the announcement. The company is targeting a 2026 debut for its proposed 19-seater, the ES-19.   The deal is part of United’s push to eliminate its carbon emissions by 2050 and thereby reduce its impact on climate change. Separately, the carrier’s United Airlines Ventures fund has also invested in Archer Aviation and made a conditional purchase of the aircraft that startup is developing, a four-seat electric air taxi with vertical takeoff and landing capability.  The ES-19, a four-engine turboprop, would fly without emitting carbon and offer a range of 250 miles (400 kilometers). United and Mesa will require the model to meet their “safety, business and operating requirements,” before they will actually buy the aircraft. Heart isn’t ready to disclose the ES-19’s price because it may change during development, Forslund said.  Heart had previously raised $6.7 million and expects to need about $500 million to develop and certify the ES-19, Forslund said. The Gothenburg, Sweden-based company was founded in 2018 in response to the Norwegian government’s mandate for all short-haul air travel to be on electric aircraft by 2040, he said.  For airlines, the ES-19 would potentially fit into a niche in the market for short-haul planes. Most regional aircraft have 50 seats or more, a capacity that’s often too large for the smallest markets. Destinations that could be served with the ES-19 include Modesto, California, and Purdue University Airport in Lafayette, Indiana, said United and Mesa, a key regional partner.  The smallest plane in United’s current fleet is a 50-seat jet. Mesa previously operated smaller turboprops for United and other carriers. In the 1990s, regional carrier Great Lakes Airlines flew 19-seat Beechcraft planes for United. Great Lakes shut down in March 2018. Heart isn’t sourcing or developing new batteries for the aircraft and will use current models available in the existing market, he said.  “It’s essentially the same type of cells as you find in a Tesla,” he said."

Hop on a ferry in Norway and it’s increasingly likely that the rumble of a diesel engine will have been replaced by the quiet hum of an electric motor. The Scandinavian nation, already a leader in electric cars, has in recent years been churning out zero-emissions vessels that could one day be used all over the world. Right now the ships mostly ply key domestic routes, especially in the mountainous west coast where ferries are an essential piece of the transportation network. But they’ve already made Norway the most electrified shipping nation in the world, thanks to an aggressive government push to cut maritime emissions. The country is home to almost three-quarters of the 274 vessels globally that run at least partly on batteries, according to a state advisory body. Its fleet of 31 fully-electric car ferries is expected to nearly double by the end of the year, says the Green Shipping Programme, a public-private partnership that supports the transition. Even the sightseeing ferries that cruise Norway’s famous fjords are transitioning to battery power. On a Saturday morning in Stavanger, along Norway’s west coast, a new ferry, the Rygerelektra, is in the harbor preparing for a tour of some nearby fjords. Measuring 42 meters long with seating capacity of nearly 300, the ferry, is owned and operated by Rødne Fjord Cruises. It is among a group of vessels from several of Norway’s leading maritime companies that are driving a shift towards zero-emissions fleet and supporting Norway’s ambitious economic reinvention away from oil and gas to alternative energy source. ""We have this closeness to the ocean in Norway, and the pinnacle of Norwegian business somehow has always sprung out of that,” says Silje Bareksten, chief sustainability officer at 3 Norske AS and a former official at Nor-shipping, a biannual maritime trade fair held in Oslo. Today, Bareksten says, the ""need to find new, ecologically and financially sustainable ways of doing business in the years to come” is gaining wider acceptance among among public and private entities, and helping to build momentum in the right direction.  When the Rygerelektra debuted last summer, a state broadcaster in Norway described it as the fastest and longest-range electric ferry in the world, a difficult feat for machinery that is battery-powered. Just as with electric automobiles, range anxiety, or rekkeviddeangst, is a real fear, acknowledges Lars Rødne, the cruise operator’s chief executive officer. “You have to make sure you can come back!” A large liquid crystal display on the bridge highlights the vessel's battery status at all times. The Rygerelektra typically starts with 85% charge. After a three-hour, 40 nautical mile round trip through the fjords – it runs at around 15 knots, but, the company says, can handle 23 knots in speed tests  — the ferry winds up back in Stavanger with about 15% battery power remaining. Rygerelektra was built by Brødrene Aa, a small family shipbuilding firm tucked inside a fjord a few hundred miles to the north of Stavanger. The company made a name for itself in the early 2000s as a pioneer in the use of carbon fiber fast ferries, vessels that largely cover trunk routes between cities along Norway’s west coast. They have over 60 such vessels today, covering deliveries in Norway and to Asia — workhorses that move quickly, and weigh far less than counterparts made from traditional metals. Over the last few years, Brødrene has branched out into all-electric vessels, delivering its first, a sightseeing ferry named Future of the Fjords, in 2018. It took the company just two years to make the leap to a fully battery-powered ship after producing a predecessor ship, Vision of the Fjords, that uses a hybrid engine. Higher efficiency carbon fiber vessels have allowed the firm to begin exploring battery-powered alternatives. “We’re going through different phases, like in the car industry,” says Lars Gimmestad, the deputy CEO at Brødrene. “The first phase was lowering emissions on traditional fuels. In one test we did, the carbon fiber reduced the fuel costs 40%. And then we stepped into the next phases.” Transport by sea is critical for people and goods in Norway's maritime regions. Road travel is slow, given the landscape and the fjords. Even though air service is an option to reach certain small communities, many rely on ferries. The Norwegian government has set out to cut emissions from domestic shipping and fisheries in half by 2030. For now, Norway’s faster, long-distance ferries — the kind that traverse the sea at 30 knots-plus between larger coastal cities —  still run on diesel. The energy density of even the most advanced batteries simply isn't enough. On the Rygerelektra, an entire room, like some kind of science fiction walk-in closet, is filled with batteries hidden behind white metal doors marked with high voltage warnings. Inside a series of fans whirred along at high speed to keep everything cool, drowning out most other sound. All to power a motor not much bigger than a large suitcase. That's led companies like Brødrene to focus on further developing and refining the technology, whether by turning to alternative fuel sources, such as hydrogen, utilizing more efficient, weight-reducing designs, improving battery technology, or some combination of all. “We're just getting started,” says Gimmestad. “As soon as we get the technology advanced a bit further and we have concepts out there that can prove distance and speed that are a bit higher than today, then I think this will come with real force.” Norway’s oil and gas wealth is what allows the country to fund an ambitious push away from fossil fuels. The government sees this as the time to plot out a post-oil future that allows Norway to maintain its current living standards using other revenue generators (and transport methods). The oil industry remains important, of course, but it is well understood that it won’t continue as it has forever. European Economic Area rules prevent Norway from directly subsidizing many of these projects, but it can reduce the financial risks for homegrown clean energy technology and defray the higher costs of buying advanced electric vessels. In 2019 ENOVA, a state-owned enterprise that distributes funds to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy, made new commitments totaling about $638 million, more than double that of the two previous years.  The money funded almost 1,500 distinct projects, including the introduction of a fully electric tugboats in Oslo. Rødne received about $2.2 million in grants to offset the cost of Rygerelektra.  Government restrictions are also accelerating the shift. Diesel ships will be banned from all of Norway’s UNESCO-designated fjords starting in 2026. Some operators have already made the switch. The Lysefjord, where Rygerelektra operates, doesn’t currently fall under that ban, but Lars Rødne thinks it’s going to extend everywhere eventually, beyond UNESCO sites. “In Norway, we need to transition from oil exports to sustainable products and services, while still utilizing the competence we have gained from the oil industry, says Pia Meling, vice president of sales and marketing at Massterly, the autonomous shipping company. “We would like to compete on the renewables and in clean shipping in particular.” Massterly’s vision is one of zero-emission, autonomous vessels moving everything from passengers around Norway to containers across oceans. Stavanger is Norway’s oil capital. The quaint city has traditionally been a shipbuilding hub as well. Just across the water from the Stavanger harbor a massive tanker is under construction, its hull still a skeleton in parts. Rødne worries that a major bottleneck for them is the lack of a high-voltage charging system at the dock.  That will become a more pressing concern as Norway’s fleet of electric ships grows. Local ferry operator Kolumbus, for instance, has announced plans to go completely emission-free by 2024. With this in mind, Rødne is working with energy company Lyse, as well as future electric-boats operators, to build infrastructure in Stavanger to support fast-charging of multiple vessels at once. Local governments can be conservative when it comes to installing new electrical infrastructure. ""There’s a lot of politics around what we’re allowed to do here,” says Rødne, who hopes the new fast charger will be online at some point this year. “It’s taking more time than we’d like. But there’s a good progression now.” Charging infrastructure and insufficient electrical grid capacity are emerging as a serious potential issue standing in the way of all-electric transport well beyond shipping. A future world in which trucks, ferries and other commercial operators run on electricity is expected to add great deal of added demand on the existing grid.  Yet there has been  growing resistance in Norway to onshore wind power – likely needed for generate more clean power. Still, solutions are emerging. Another Brødrene electric ferry that runs in the remote town of Flåm, cruising the UNESCO-listed Nærøyfjord, risked faced the problem that the local grid might not be able to support the kind of voltage it would need to charge quickly enough to stick to its schedule. So a special charging dock was developed, something like a power brick for a phone except much larger, that would slowly charge off the grid continuously, and then deliver a fast charge directly to the ship whenever it came in to dock. For all the developments, the public and some in government have questioned the pace of change. Kirsten Å. Øystese, project manager at the Norwegian Climate Foundation in Bergen, says Norway’s progress in electrifying  its maritime fleets is impressive, and ahead of many other European countries. But challenges remain. “The shipping sector is almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels, and still needs to make substantial cuts in emissions to play its part in meeting the Paris Climate Agreement goals,"" Øystese says. ""The sector must aim for net zero emissions by 2050, and that will require significant increase in use of batteries, shore power and hydrogen-based fuels such as ammonia.” Meanwhile Brødrene is making moves to serve markets beyond Norway. The firm attracted the interest of Chinese shipping giant Chu Kong Shipping in 2016, a meeting which led to the formation of a joint venture and a shared production facility in Guangzhou. There they crank out their signature carbon fiber diesel ships for use in the Pearl River Delta, a market with enormous potential for both conventional and electric vessels. Another potential market is Hong Kong, which has been looking closely at electrifying their vast commuter ferry fleet. Interest has also come from San Francisco’s Water Emergency Transport Authority (WETA), which wants to explore options for moving to zero-emissions as they expand ferry service in the Bay Area. There’s plenty of potential, but the priority for Brødrene now are the contracts it has with ferry operators throughout Norway. Growth with international clients, while promising, will have to come gradually, says Gimmestad. The math works out for potential investors, says Brødrene Chief Executive Officer Tor Oyvin Aa. The emission-free ferries are more expensive to acquire, but “capital is very cheap now,” he says. For example, companies might invest about 30% more in upfront costs, but save twice that on fuel.  And those numbers continue to get better. While batteries weighed around 12 kilograms per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of power just a few years ago, they’re now at around 8kg per kWh and could get to 6kg/kWh soon. In 2016 Brødrene delivered Vision of the Fjords which could run 8 nautical miles on electricity. By 2018, it produced the Legacy of the Fjords that managed 20 nautical miles fully electric. Now Rygerelektra can serve a 40 nautical mile route. Aa says the biggest opportunity will be in commuting ferries, and from coastal cities on the Mediterranean in particular, helped in part by the depressed oil price which has weakened the Norwegian krona and made their ships cheaper for Europeans. In January the company sold three of its latest “Aero” carbon fiber diesel ferries to a Greek operator, and more orders, potentially including electric variants, are expected from the region. “There are traffic jams just about everywhere now,” says Aa. “So if you can move people onto the waterways and do it emission free, that’s really something. The water is lying there,” he says with a smile. “You don’t need maintenance on the sea. And it costs less and it’s emission free.”"

The so-called Maker electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle will have a 60-mile range and fly at 150 mph when it enters commercial service in 2024, according to Palo Alto, California-based Archer. Source: Archer Archer executives debuted their Maker vehicle at a glitzy event on Thursday evening in Hawthorne, California, about five miles from Los Angeles International Airport. The company also plans to operate in Miami. Airlines and other companies see a future where eVTOLs help ease traffic congestion by moving commuters in small electric aircraft, free of carbon emissions. United Airlines Holdings Inc. has invested $20 million in Archer, which said in February it plans to merge with a special purpose acquisition company overseen by investment banker Ken Moelis later this year. That deal valued the startup at $3.8 billion. United also plans to acquire as many as 200 Makers from Archer if the aircraft meets its performance and operational needs. The Maker’s public debut occurred the same day United rival American Airlines Group Inc. said it would preorder 250 four-seat VA-X4 electric aircraft developed by U.K.-based Vertical Aerospace Group Ltd. American also said it had invested $25 million in Vertical. Two other eVTOL companies, Joby Aviation and Lilium GmbH, have agreed to go public through SPAC mergers. The Maker’s development has been overshadowed by litigation. Rival eVTOL developer Wisk Aero LLC sued Archer in U.S. court in April, alleging theft of its technology. Wisk, a venture backed by Boeing Co. and Google billionaire Larry Page’s Kitty Hawk Corp., alleges that former employees took files and secret designs from the company before going to work for Archer. On June 1, Archer filed a motion denying Wisk’s allegations and asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit."

And with thousands of passenger planes, which usually carry about half of global air freight, still grounded, capacity constraints will continue to push up prices, according to Tim Scharwath, the chief executive officer of DHL Global Forwarding, Freight. “People are very willing to spend, they have more money left because they didn’t go on holiday,” Scharwath said in an interview. Air cargo capacity “will also be scarce into 2022” because slow vaccine rollouts in Asia will dissuade people from traveling, he said. Airfreight rates to North America from Hong Kong have risen as much as 24% this year after more than doubling in 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic increased demand for electronics goods like gaming consoles and laptop computers as more people were forced to work from home. The cargo market has been a rare bright spot for Asian carriers such as Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Korean Air Lines Co., whose businesses have been decimated by the pandemic. Demand for airfreight is growing in automotive and industrial industries as well as for plastics and chemical goods, as companies restock inventories as economies bounce back faster-than-expected, Scharwath said. Delays in seaborne shipping due to bottlenecks at ports and a lack of containers have also diverted some cargo, such as garden furniture to planes, he said. Seafreight costs have surged, making air freight more competitive. The spot price for a 40-foot container to be shipped to Los Angeles from Shanghai has risen 34% this year, while rates for Shanghai-Rotterdam have surged 49%, according to the Drewry World Container Index.  Transporting goods by rail between China and Europe has also increased, with demand growing between 10% to 20% since last year, Scharwath said. “We use rail now which is normally way too expensive, but because ocean-freight rates are so high customers demand it,” Scharwath said. “If ocean freight goes over a certain threshold, rail becomes more attractive.”"

New York state reported more than 1,000 new cases for first time since mid-May, as a city council member called for renewed mask mandates in indoor public spaces. “We need to reverse this trend,” City Councilman Mark D. Levine, who chairs the health committee, tweeted on Saturday. This week, Los Angeles reimposed mask mandates indoors -- regardless of vaccination status -- and San Francisco and Las Vegas issued mask recommendations as cases driven by the delta variant continue to rise. The variant now represents 41% of samples tested in New York City, a jump from 26% for the previous week. Earlier this week, Mayor Bill de Blasio said there were no plans to reimpose mask mandates in New York City. At the state level, 1,156 new infections were reported on Saturday by Governor Andrew Cuomo after daily case counts briefly dipped below 300 in June. The positive test rate has also been rising, to a seven-day average of 1.19%. Hospitalizations remain low, at 354, as do deaths, at 4. Thousands took to the streets across France on Saturday to protest President Emmanuel Macron’s move to pressure people into getting Covid-19 vaccinations -- even as large numbers of their fellow citizens are signing up. A vaccination center in the Isere department was vandalized last night, Le Figaro reported. Earlier this week Macron made Covid-19 shots mandatory for health care workers and decided that so-called “health passes” -- which show proof of testing or immunization -- should be obligatory to access venues such as restaurants and cafes. The “health pass” is backed by about 62% of citizens, the Le Parisien newspaper reported today, citing an Ipsos/Sopra Steria opinion poll. “The delta variant is there, we can’t hide it,” Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Saturday. “The only solution is getting vaccinated.” France is giving logistics support to Tunisia to fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, the French Ministry of Armed Forces said in a statement on Saturday. The army was mobilized to transport liquid oxygen to Tunisia. Medical material will follow in coming days, President Emmanuel Macron said in a tweet. The U.K. reported 54,674 new Covid cases on Saturday, the most since Jan. 15 as the spread of the delta variant pushes infection rates near records for the entire pandemic. Hospitalizations rose to 3,964, the most since late March. The success of the country’s vaccine drive has limited death counts under the latest wave, with 41 deaths reported Saturday, compared with more than 1,800 in a single day at the peak in January. British Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he tested positive for Covid-19, less than a month after returning to Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s cabinet to lead the government’s response to the pandemic. Johnson may have to spend Monday, which he has dubbed “Freedom Day,” in self-isolation because he met Javid on Friday. The U.K. is due to remove virtually all coronavirus restrictions on Monday. Senegal President Macky Sall renewed calls for people to avoid gatherings ahead of the West African nation’s most celebrated holiday due to a surge in coronavirus cases. The appeal comes days before the Eid al-Kebir holiday, known as Tabaski in Senegal, a predominantly Muslim country. Senegal, which has reported 49,008 coronavirus cases so far, has seen the number of infections rise 12% over the past two weeks. France confirmed it’s toughening rules on travel and boosting border checks from Sunday in an effort to contain a spike in cases linked to the Covid-19 delta variant, and to avoid further lockdowns. Travelers from the U.K. without proof of full vaccination must test negative for Covid-19 within 24 hours of travel, the prime minister’s office said in a statement. Late on Friday the U.K. said arrivals from France would need to quarantine for 10 days, beginning on Monday, regardless of vaccination status. Reeling from the delta variant, the U.K. is now looking to contain the beta variant. Non-fully vaccinated travelers from Spain, Portugal, Cyprus, the Netherlands and Greece, EU countries where cases are rising sharply, will also need a negative test taken less than 24 hours before arrival in France. Visitors vaccinated with a version of the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine made by India’s Serum Institute will now be allowed to enter France, the statement said. Taiwan’s top health official indicated he’s likely to lift soft-lockdown measures when they expire on July 26, giving a boost to sectors struggling to stay afloat amid widespread Covid-19 restrictions. Cases have fallen rapidly, and the Centers for Disease Control reported just eight new local infections Saturday, the first single-digit total since May 11. Malaysia added 12,528 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, according to the health ministry, a day after the government decided not to extend tightened movement restrictions in Selangor. The country’s most industrialized state accounted for the majority of cases, with 4,985 new infections, followed by capital city Kuala Lumpur at 1,740. Malaysia is struggling to curb new cases, which surpassed a record 13,000 for the first time on Thursday. The country plans to ease restrictions for individuals who have been fully inoculated and may allow companies to be fully operational if their workers receive both doses of vaccine. Almost 13% of the population have been fully vaccinated, and the government aims to boost that to 60% by the end of September. Two Los Angeles officials are pushing back on the county health department’s plans to impose the use of masks indoors regardless of vaccination status. Sheriff Alex Villanueva said the order, set to take effect at 11:59 p.m. on Saturday, isn’t “backed by science” and contradicts Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. A county board supervisor said departing from California’s state policies creates confusion at the local level. “I am concerned by rising cases, but I don’t believe the mask mandate will help efforts to stress vaccine efficacy and compel unvaccinated residents to get vaccinated,” said Kathryn Barger, one of the county’s supervisors. Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo urged ministers to adopt a “sense of crisis” as the country overtook Brazil in daily coronavirus cases to become the worst in the world. Jokowi, as the president is known, called off a paid vaccination plan and told state officials not to travel overseas after a wide public backlash, urging them to exercise “social sensitivity,” Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung said. Only the foreign minister and those given special permission by the president can travel abroad, he added. “The president has emphasized that in this period of emergency curbs, surely there must be a sense of crisis throughout all ministries, institutions and leaders,” Anung said. Thailand banned gatherings nationwide and may implement further restrictions as the country saw daily coronavirus cases and deaths surge to fresh records. The Southeast Asian nation reported 10,082 new infections on Saturday, exceeding 10,000 for the first time, despite the imposition of lockdown-like restrictions since Monday. There were 141 deaths, data from the Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration show. Members of the public wait in line at a Covid-19 testing site set up at Suan Luang Rama VIII bridge in Bangkok, on July 16. The Tokyo Olympic Games registered its first coronavirus case at the athletes’ village, less than a week before the opening ceremony. A foreign personnel member -- not an athlete -- tested positive and is in quarantine, a document from organizers showed on Saturday. So far there have been 45 positive cases tied to the Tokyo Games, but this is the first to come from within the Olympic Village. The infections underscore the challenge for organizers who’ve pledged to provide a safe Olympics. Prefectures surrounding Tokyo expanded an advisory limiting restaurant openings, alcohol sales and spectator numbers. Lockdown measures across Sydney are being tightened as authorities struggle to contain the delta variant, with tougher rules applied to retail trading and some emerging local hotspots subject to extra movement restrictions. A health worker collects swab sample at a Covid-19 testing clinic in Sydney, on July 17. The government ordered non-critical retail outlets to shutter from midnight. Construction work must cease until July 30, when the current lockdown order is due to end. The state recorded 111 new cases on Saturday, including 29 that were infectious in the community despite being told to stay at home, bringing the total cases in the current outbreak to well over 1,000. Supermarkets, pharmacists and banks are allowed to remain open. Singapore will donate excess vaccines under the Covax initiative, and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong urged countries with advanced inoculation programs to do the same. Lee didn’t specify when the donations will be made or the amount of doses it will share. He was speaking at an online gathering of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders on Friday. Separately, the city-state said it will temporarily close hundreds of nightlife venues and re-enforce stricter measures for dining-in days after relaxing them, amid a surge in daily cases linked to a karaoke cluster. The country will impose different restrictions on the population based on their vaccination status. U.K. Health Secretary Sajid Javid tested positive, two days before England lifts almost all Covid-19 curbs. In France, thousands took to the streets to protest President Emmanuel Macron’s move to pressure people into getting Covid-19 vaccinations. The Tokyo Olympics registered its first case at the athletes’ village, less than a week before the opening ceremony. Sydney authorities tightened lockdown measure, and Singapore is temporarily closing hundreds of nightlife venues.

Carriers welcomed an agreement by President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Boris Johnson to create a joint task force to explore options for resuming flights, but are pushing for their administrations to go further than the tentative gesture. International Airlines Group CEO Luis Gallego discusses the revival of international travel. Setbacks with the virus have repeatedly frustrated efforts to reignite the market. Most recently, the Delta variant first identified in India has quickly driven up infection rates in the U.K. That’s forced the government into retreat on travel at the start of the usually busy summer season, when airlines were hoping for an acceleration. “We’re encouraged by this show of mutual will for reopening the trans-Atlantic corridor,” Stacy Day, a spokeswoman for American Airlines, said of the U.S.-U.K. task force. “We’ll continue to be willing and eager partners to the U.S. and U.K. governments as their conversations progress.” In parallel with the talks with the U.K., the U.S. is also studying how to reopen travel links with counterparts in the European Union. Countries including Italy, Greece and France are slowly lifting barriers to entry by Americans as part of an overall push to ease movement to and within the bloc. But the opening hasn’t been reciprocated by the U.S. Speaking on an Airlines for Europe industry panel Thursday, Deutsche Lufthansa AG CEO Carsten Spohr said that while he’s hopeful for progress toward a resumption in trans-Atlantic travel, it would be discouraging if the U.K. summit were to pass without concrete progress. Spohr said he understood that the outcome of recent British talks in the U.S. had been “quite disappointing,” and that it wasn’t clear what requirements the Biden administration had for resuming inbound travel. “To have this summit go by without some kind of comment on this would be very awkward,” Spohr said. “I can’t believe this will happen, but we have been surprised so many times in this pandemic, all of us.” “Quickly is the key,” said Airlines for America, a group that includes industry leaders like Delta Air Lines Inc., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. “We believe the science is already there.” Vaccinated people ought to be able to travel, Luis Gallego, chief executive officer of British Airways parent IAG SA, added in a Bloomberg TV interview. Given progress with rolling out inoculations in both countries, “we don’t see why they have to have restrictions between the U.S. and the U.K.” The North Atlantic corridor joining the U.S. with Europe is the single most profitable corner of the global aviation market, filled with premium travelers paying extra for first-class and business-class seats. The connection pumps billions of dollars into the British and American economies and supports hundreds of thousands of jobs, according to Drew Crawley, chief commercial officer of American Express Global Business Travel. “The continued closure of these vital routes for more than 400 days has been detrimental to economic recovery in both countries,” Crawley said. Throughout the pandemic, carriers on both sides of the Atlantic have lobbied forcefully for a relaxation of travel curbs, a call they renewed this week ahead of the G7 summit meeting in Cornwall."

Canada became the first nation to clear the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for adolescents. U.S. cases could see a sharp decline by July if nationwide vaccination efforts continue to be successful, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The U.S. will support a proposal to waive intellectual-property protections for vaccines, joining an effort to increase global supply and close the gap between rich and poor nations. Canada is considering allowing patients to receive two different types of vaccines as the country deals with shortages of shots from AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc. Federal health officials are closely watching a U.K.-based trial in which participants received two kinds of shots. Results are expected in the next month or so, said Supriya Sharma, chief medical adviser at Health Canada. If adopted, the new protocol would mark another major deviation from original vaccine guidelines. Canada has opted to extend the length of time between mRNA vaccines from the recommended three to four weeks to as long as four months, in order to stretch supplies. A Colorado woman who suffered a rare blood clot after receiving Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine urged others to get a shot just the same. Morgan Wolfe, 40, of Denver, told the Colorado Sun: “Despite everything that’s happened, I definitely still think that it’s important to keep on pushing for as much of the country and as much of the world to get vaccinated as possible” “Obviously, I had a bad reaction to this one. And that’s unfortunate for me, but I do still think that there’s a place for it in the overall strategy,” Wolfe said. Moderna Inc.’s booster shots gave positive results against immune system-evading strains that emerged in South Africa and Brazil, according to early results from a mid-stage trial. Two types of booster shots studied spurred higher levels of virus-halting antibodies, Moderna said in a statement. One of the boosters is an additional low-dose shot of its existing vaccine, while the other type is customized against the South Africa strain. “We are encouraged by these new data, which reinforce our confidence that our booster strategy should be protective against these newly detected variants,” Stephane Bancel, Moderna’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. “We will continue to make as many updates to our Covid-19 vaccine as necessary to control the pandemic.” The U.S. will back a proposal to waive intellectual-property protections for Covid-19 vaccines, joining an effort to increase global supply and access to the life-saving shots as the gap between rich and poor nations widens. “We are for the waiver at the WTO, we are for what the proponents of the waiver are trying to accomplish, which is better access, more manufacturing capability, more shots in arms,” U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in an interview on Wednesday. The Biden administration will now actively take part in negotiations for the text of the waiver at the World Trade Organization and encourage other countries to back it, Tai said. She acknowledged the talks will take time and “will not be easy,” given the complexity of the issue and the fact that the Geneva-based WTO is a member-driven organization that can only make decisions based on consensus. President Joe Biden visited a Washington restaurant owned in part by Mexican immigrants on Wednesday to highlight $28.6 billion in federal aid for restaurants that struggled during the pandemic. Under the Covid-19 relief measure Biden signed in March, restaurants can apply for grants ranging from $1,000 to $5 million per location, or $10 million for those with 20 or fewer locations. Pandemic disruptions severely hampered U.S. regulators’ ability to inspect drug and device makers’ manufacturing plants, delaying at least 68 applications for approval to market new products, according to a Food and Drug Administration review. Seven of the delayed applications were mission-critical, meaning they represented a medical advancement, the agency said Wednesday in its report, and six of those were for new drugs. The delayed applications were among 600 where the FDA required a factory inspection before approval decisions. New York Yankees and Mets stadiums will reopen to all fans on May 19, with separate sections for vaccinated and unvaccinated spectators. Those who are vaccinated can sit together at 100% capacity, as long as they wear masks. The unvaccinated fans will need to wear masks and also observe a 6-foot (1.8-meter) social distancing rule, which works out to about 33% capacity in those sections, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday. Fans will be able to get vaccines at the games, under a deal between the state and the teams. Those who get a shot at a game will get a free ticket to another game, Cuomo said. New York joins several other states offering incentives for vaccines as the pace of inoculations slow. The governor also announced that Broadway tickets will go on sale Thursday, with shows starting Sept. 14 at full capacity, Cuomo said. U.S. Covid-19 cases could see a sharp decline by July if nationwide vaccination efforts continue to be successful, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Researchers used scenario modeling techniques to show long-term projections of potential trends in Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in data released Wednesday in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Canadian public health officials authorized the use of the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE Covid vaccine for teenagers, making Canada the first nation to do so. Supriya Sharma, chief medical adviser with Health Canada, made the announcement Wednesday at a press conference. The department determined the vaccine was “safe and effective” for the younger age group, Sharma said. The U.S. is considering similar action. The Food and Drug Administration is likely to issue an emergency authorization for use of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for adolescents “within several days,” said White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci. “I think it is going to be very soon,” Fauci said during an interview with NBC News. “I mean, I don’t want to get ahead of the FDA, but I believe it is going to be within several days.” The U.K. insisted a meeting of top Group of Seven diplomats in London should go ahead after India’s foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said he would self-isolate over possible exposure to coronavirus. Was made aware yesterday evening of exposure to possible Covid positive cases. As a measure of abundant caution and also out of consideration for others, I decided to conduct my engagements in the virtual mode. That will be the case with the G7 Meeting today as well. The news risked derailing a high-profile event that marked the G-7 debut of U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Britain is hosting the gathering, which began on Tuesday. Thailand is planning to spend billions of dollars for financial relief to low-income groups to cope with the economic hit from the biggest outbreak sweeping the nation since the pandemic began. The cabinet on Wednesday approved in principle fiscal stimulus measures, including extension of two cash handout programs by a month at a cost of 85.5 billion baht ($2.8 billion). It also proposed 140 billion baht of spending for co-payment and e-voucher programs and more cash handouts to welfare cardholders and special groups to stimulate consumption, officials said. Malaysia tightened restrictions on movements in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur to defuse a fresh wave of coronavirus infections, a day after it imposed similar curbs in the nation’s richest state of Selangor. The movement control order will be in force from May 7 to May 20, Defense Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said in a statement on Wednesday. Dining at restaurants is prohibited and curbs on inter-state travel remain, the minister said.

The judges said that while government ministers had failed to properly tie the quarantine requirements for travelers returning home with the U.K.’s color-coded system, they would not force the government to reveal its reasoning behind the categories. It was enough, they said, that ministers continue to review the rules. The challenge was brought by the owner of Stansted and Manchester airports and supported by a number of airlines including Ryanair Holdings Plc, British Airways’ parent IAG SA, Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd and EasyJet Plc. The group said travelers need to understand how the government takes decisions on the traffic light system. “The way decisions have been taken to date has not been transparent and has created huge confusion and uncertainty,” the group said in a joint statement after the ruling. The group’s lawyers had asked to see the government’s data that informed the U.K.’s risk assessments for each country during the pandemic. They argued that the government’s “fundamental lack of transparency” means that the basis for categorizing territories between the green or amber lists “appears arbitrary.” The U.K. went further last week in its traffic light border system, creating a new “amber plus” category that makes it harder to travel to France, the only country with that designation. “Our traffic light system continues to cautiously manage the risk of new variants, as we balance the timely reopening of international travel while safeguarding public health and protecting the vaccine roll-out,” the transport department said in an emailed statement."
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-04/lufthansa-sees-delay-in-breaking-even-after-8-1-billion-loss,2021-03-04T06:00:06.845Z,Lufthansa Sees Delayed Recovery After Record Annual Loss,['William Wilkes'],Business,"Deutsche Lufthansa AG struck a more pessimistic tone after reporting the biggest loss in the airline’s history, saying it might need until the middle of the decade to recover from the coronavirus pandemic that’s ravaged the industry. Europe’s biggest airline group warned Thursday that it may be able to operate only 90% of its pre-pandemic capacity by then, a sign of deteriorating confidence in a revival after Lufthansa previously suggested the market could recover fully by 2024. Lufthansa will struggle to make money on flights before the end of this year as it dials back capacity plans. Planes more than 25 years old may be decommissioned, adding to dozens of earlier retirements. Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr said there could still be a revival of passenger traffic this summer, but only if enough vaccines are given. “We need more-practical solutions to overcome the restrictions we currently have,” Spohr said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “We expect demand to pick up again as soon as restrictive travel limits are reduced by a further rollout of tests and vaccines.” Lufthansa shares fell as much as 4.2% and traded 3.4% lower at 12.47 euros as of 4:30 p.m. in Frankfurt. The shares have advanced 14% this year after losing a third of their value in 2020. Network carriers like Lufthansa have seen the long-haul markets on which they depend almost wiped out by the pandemic. These routes, which rely heavily on business travel, are expected to be among the last to recover. Lufthansa said it’s able to rush back as much 70% of capacity in short order if demand picks up. It’s also expanding its low-cost long-haul business to target a revival in tourism while corporate travel is dormant. But more progress needs to be made on restructuring at the sprawling airline group, especially at the main German brand, Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska wrote after the company posted a record 6.7 billion-euro ($8.1 billion) annual loss. “While we can see tangible progress on labor in Swiss, Austrian, Brussels and Eurowings,” Roeska wrote, “Lufthansa mainline is still stuck at step 1 here with crisis agreements only. More needs to happen – and faster.” Lufthansa’s reassessment of the hoped-for rebound comes with travel still largely locked down and the European Union struggling to accelerate Covid-19 vaccine rollouts after a sluggish start. It echoes recent concernss spanning the International Air Transport Association, which said last month airlines could burn through $95 billion this year, almost double the previous forecast, to planemaker Airbus SE, which unexpectedly forecast jet handovers will remain at 2020’s depressed levels. Lufthansa now expects to deploy between 40% and 50% of its 2019 capacity levels this year, according to a statement, compared with a previous target of 40% to 60%. That’s bad news for profitability, given that it needs to operate with around half of available capacity to stem cash outflows. Redburn analyst James Goodall said that estimate of the break-even point may in itself be “too ambitious” given that almost 60% of the carrier’s revenues come from business traffic. Short-haul leisure specialists such as Ryanair Holdings Plc and EasyJet Plc may reap a earlier rebound, especially if a faster vaccination rollout in the U.K. allows Britons to make a more rapid return to Mediterranean beaches. The European Union is three or four months away from issuing coronavirus immunity certificates, raising the prospect of another lost tourism season for the bloc’s aviation and hospitality industries, according to a briefing note circulated to national delegations in Brussels on Tuesday. Lufthansa said it cut capital spending by two-thirds in 2020, after full-year revenues dropped 63%. The outlay on aircraft will shrink in future years as it cuts the fleet to 650 planes by 2023 from more than 750 at the end of last year. A delayed recovery raises the prospect of the German state retaining a major holding in Lufthansa for longer if it renders the carrier less able to repay borrowings. Lufthansa has tapped the government for 9 billion euros, handing over a 20% stake in the company. Davy Stockbrokers analyst Stephen Furlong said the airline now faces faces “a long and painful process.” of restructuring and deleveraging."

The carrier, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., posted a loss of 11.5 billion rupees ($157 million) in the three months through March, its fourth quarter, widening from a loss of 8.7 billion rupees a year earlier. The average forecast from analysts was for a deficit of 4.5 billion rupees. IndiGo’s revenue performance will deteriorate in the quarter ending June compared with the March quarter, Chief Executive Officer Ronojoy Dutta said in a conference call Monday. IndiGo is expecting domestic travel to reach February levels by the third quarter of 2022, while near-term outlook for international recovery is weak and has been delayed till the fourth quarter of 2022, Dutta said. IndiGo is working on securing credit lines from lenders and entering into sales and leaseback arrangements for new aircraft, which will result in additional liquidity of 45 billion rupees for the coming year, IndiGo Chief Financial Officer Jiten Chopra said. IndiGo’s fleet count will be flat as it’s taking deliveries and returning new aircraft at the same speed, Dutta said. “This has been a very difficult year with our revenues slumping hard due to Covid, showing some signs of recovery during the period December to February and then slumping again with the second wave of Covid,” Dutta said in a statement Saturday. “While we have seen a sharp decline in revenues in March through May, we are encouraged by the modest revenue improvements starting last week of May and continuing through June.” The pandemic has pushed many airlines around the world to the brink and beyond, and the intensity of the outbreak in India has made it extra hard for operators there. The country’s carriers will need about $5 billion to survive, but they only have access to about $1.1 billion through share offerings and other means, according to CAPA Centre for Aviation. IndiGo and Air India Ltd. will account for the bulk of the $8 billion in losses by 2022, CAPA said. India had for a while been fairly robust for airlines thanks to its vast domestic network, though any positivity evaporated with the arrival of a devastating virus wave, which put the brakes on travel. The numbers are staggering, and likely under-reported. Latest data show nearly 30 million confirmed Covid-19 cases and more than 349,000 deaths. Mark D Martin, CEO of Martin Consulting, said he expects IndiGo to return to profit in the year through March 2023 if India manages to curb the virus. IndiGo said traffic, measured by revenue passenger per kilometer, dropped 29% in the first three months of 2021 from a year earlier. It filled 70.2% of its seats in the quarter, compared with 82.9% a year earlier. The carrier had 185.7 billion rupees of cash and 298.6 billion rupees of total debt as of March 31. InterGlobe’s shares pared early gains Monday to close little changed at 1,755.45 rupees in Mumbai. “We have run out of words to describe the state of Indian airlines,” CAPA said in its India Airline Outlook last week. “But as we have repeatedly emphasized, the industry is standing on the edge of a cliff. This is true even for airlines with access to large pools of capital.” IndiGo had been planning last year to raise as much as 40 billion rupees by selling new shares, getting board approval in August. It then dropped the plan in January, saying internal sources of cash would be sufficient as demand started to recover. That optimism was soon snuffed out as India’s outbreak intensified. The board is now considering raising capital again."

Britons who have received both doses of a coronavirus vaccine are set to be given more freedom to travel around the world from July 19, under plans due to be announced Thursday. Officials have been working on an overhaul of the pandemic rules for foreign trips so that passengers returning to England from destinations on the government’s “amber list” -- judged to be medium risk for coronavirus -- won’t need to isolate for 10 days. Instead they will be told to take Covid tests after arrival, people familiar with the matter said. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will set out the measures, which will also detail how the new rules will affect under-18s who are not currently being vaccinated, in a statement to the U.K. Parliament. The change is set to come into force from July 19 when other pandemic rules are eased. It will coincide with the start of the school holidays, and will be a boost to the ailing travel industry, which has struggled with lockdowns and closed borders for more than a year. “Double vaccination is a great liberator,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in evidence to a committee in Parliament on Wednesday. “In principle and in practice, it’s going to be great.” Under existing rules on foreign travel, visitors to more than 100 destinations including the vital U.S. market and some of the most popular European destinations are required to isolate for 10 days on their return to the U.K. That’s because these destinations are on the government’s “amber list,” rated as medium risk for coronavirus. The government currently advises Britons not to travel to destinations on the amber list or the high risk red list, with only a handful of countries judged to be safe enough to put on the green list. Johnson and his team are grappling with how best to reopen the economy now that 65% of U.K. adults have received both doses of Covid vaccines. Yet even as the rollout of shots continues, a surge in infections from the delta variant is complicating the government’s efforts to lift restrictions. On Wednesday, 32,548 people tested positive for Covid-19, and another 33 deaths were recorded. Officials have suggested that as many as 100,000 new cases a day could be recorded later this summer. While most pandemic restrictions in England will end July 19, the requirement to isolate if a person has been in contact with a positive case will continue until Aug. 16. That delay to ending the isolation requirement for “close contacts” has fueled concern that millions of people will be forced to stay at home, damaging efforts to reopen businesses. On Wednesday, Johnson defended his policy on self-isolation, saying the government needed to “balance” the risks. “This is a highly contagious disease. We have to do what we can to stop its spread,” he said. Kate Nicholls, boss of trade body UKHospitality, said the sector was suffering “carnage” and the delay to ditching the isolation rules will discriminate against the younger workforce who will not have been offered both doses of the vaccines by Aug. 16. “With cases predicted to continue to rise, this means that hospitality’s recovery after 16 months of lockdown and severely disrupted trading will be harmed,” she said."

While the hub will open with a lone Airbus SE A321 jet in October, Budapest-based Wizz sees scope to quickly expand it to employ 800 people, an operation that would support a further 4,000 jobs, Chief Executive Officer Jozsef Varadi said in an interview. Wizz is seeking to leverage the European airline industry’s lowest cost base to grab market share in London as the coronavirus crisis pushes other carriers to trim their fleets. Varadi said the plan is being frustrated by the suspension during the pandemic of rules that usually force incumbents to relinquish slots the following year if they fail to use 80% of them. “If airlines are unable to operate slots they should be returned to a pool so that carriers can access them, bring in revenue and contribute to the local economy,” Varadi said. Wizz Air shares rose as much as 2.3% in London. The stock is down 5.6% this year, the third-best performance in the 28-member Bloomberg World Airlines Index. Wizz is lobbying authorities including regulators in both the U.K. and the European Union to drop the waiver as flying resumes, Varadi said. He said in a Bloomberg TV interview that Wizz would consider a transaction to obtain them. He added that the carrier seeks to rehire 1,000 staff in the coming months. The European Commission has said the slot-rule suspension is temporary and aimed at protecting the industry, while also removing the need for airlines to fly empty planes just to keep flying rights. It is set to expire Oct. 24, though the EU has said it’s considering an extension. “It distorts the market should the slot waiver get extended into the winter period,” Varadi said. “We think it should firmly end at the end of October and the market should decide who gets those slots.” While the measure applies across Europe, it’s a particular issue at Gatwick because British Airways, Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. and Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA all have suspended operations there, leaving a large number of slots at the south London facility in limbo, the CEO said. EasyJet Plc, the biggest airline operator at Gatwick, has resumed service at a slower pace than Wizz. Gatwick is operating at about 30% of its year-ago capacity, compared with 70% at Luton airport, Wizz’s original U.K. hub north of London, according to Eurocontrol data. IAG SA’s British Airways, which has used Gatwick mainly for leisure flights, has begun to reinstate some long-haul trips, though European services won’t resume until November at the earliest. Norwegian’s Gatwick operations remain suspended with just two service running, from Oslo and Copenhagen. The carrier has said long-haul flights may not resume until April. Virgin Atlantic has closed its entire Gatwick operation while not ruling out a resumption in the future. Virgin Atlantic Woos Creditors to Nail Down $1.6 Billion Rescue Wizz, Europe’s third-biggest discount airline behind Ryanair Holdings Plc and EasyJet, currently bases 10 planes at Luton with a further 20 flying in from other locations. Gatwick could ultimately support an operation of at least that size, Varadi said. A higher number of planes would be directly based at Gatwick because the bulk of passengers would be Britons making leisure trips to the continent. That contrasts with Luton, where a majority of passengers are flying in to the U.K. to work or visit friends and family. Virgin CEO Shai Weiss has said his company might lease out its Gatwick slots until the long-haul market in which it specializes revives. Varadi previously ruled out such an arrangement, saying the investment required to build up a new market is too great not to have certainty over access. Wizz sought to establish itself as a force at Gatwick last year, when it was a contender for slots from failed Thomas Cook Group Plc. Those were bought by EasyJet, while positions vacated by Monarch Airlines in 2017 went to BA owner IAG SA after Wizz had bid."

The actions, announced Wednesday by the Federal Aviation Administration, closed out the longest grounding of a jetliner in U.S. history and set the stage for other regulators to clear the Max, which would allow airlines worldwide to resume passenger service with the plane. The FAA decision is a dramatic turning point for Boeing after more than two years of bad news surrounding its best-selling model. But the aircraft’s return won’t mean an immediate end to the controversy or a cash infusion for the company’s suffering bottom line. A criminal probe by the U.S. Justice Department continues. Frayed relations with the FAA threaten to result in fines or other penalties and the Securities and Exchange Commission also has an open investigation. Meanwhile, the Covid-19 pandemic has crushed the airline industry, prompting airlines to cancel orders for the Max and thwarting Boeing’s plans to quickly reverse its losses. “It’s Boeing’s most important program and the United States’ most important manufactured product, but you couldn’t ask for a worse market right now,” Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst with Teal Group, said before the FAA’s move. “It’s not a question of opening the floodgates and watching the cash pour in the way it would’ve been a year ago.” Boeing rose less than 1% to $211.64 at 1:16 p.m. in New York following the news, which had been expected for weeks. Through Tuesday, the shares had lost 50% of their value since the March 10, 2019 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines Group flight that triggered the global grounding of the 737 Max. FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said the plane that had roiled the reputations of the industry and his agency is now “the most heavily scrutinized airplane in transport aircraft history.” The accidents forced the FAA to “reset” its relationship with Boeing and to collaborate more closely with other nations, he said. “The end result is that I’m fully confident the airplane is safe and I’d put my own family on it. It’d fly it myself,” Dickson said in an interview. The former airline executive and pilot flew a Max on Sept. 30. Boeing Chief Executive Officer David Calhoun, who took control of the company during the Max crisis, said the company has learned “hard lessons” from the crashes and grounding. “We will never forget the 346 victims,” Calhoun told employees Wednesday morning. “We will honor them by holding close the hard lessons learned from this chapter in our history to ensure accidents like these never happen again.” The FAA is requiring repairs to a safety system that went haywire in the two crashes and multiple other flaws discovered during months of reviews. It also mandated new pilot training for the Max, focusing on issues that arose in the accidents. The actions are unlikely to quell controversy surrounding the plane. Family members of those killed in an Ethiopian Airlines crash on March 10, 2019, some of whom have said the jet should never fly again, “reacted with sheer disappointment and renewed grief,” according to an emailed statement. Boeing’s Max is Back. Are You Ready to Board?: Brooke Sutherland The Max’s comeback will be gradual. It won’t be widely flown for several months as airlines must first train pilots, inspect jets emerging from long desert sojourns and complete the FAA-mandated repairs. Of the U.S. operators, only American Airlines Group Inc. has put the Max jets back into its schedule, with flights starting Dec. 29 on a lone round trip: Miami to New York. Grounded Boeing 737 Max airplanes in Seattle. The FAA is requiring repairs to a safety system that went haywire in the two crashes and multiple other flaws discovered during months of reviews. The Allied Pilots Association, which represents American’s cockpit crews, is “confident” in the plane and the new training regimen, said Pete Gamble, who led the union’s input for the Max’s return. “This has been 20 months of deliberate looking at the process,” Gamble said of the training. “One thing about this airplane coming back -- it’s not a victory party. This is a lot of hard work that’s gone into correcting a problem where, unfortunately, people lost their lives.” Southwest Airlines Co. plans to put its entire pilot workforce through the new training before reintroducing the Max, delaying the return by months. CEO Gary Kelly said the airline is confident in Boeing’s fixes and that executives plan to fly in the jet before it is reintroduced to Southwest’s fleet. The airline faces “thousands of hours of work, inspections, and the software updates before any of our customers board a Southwest 737 MAX,” he said in a message to employees Wednesday. United Airlines Holdings Inc., the other U.S. carrier with the Max, expects to resume service in the first quarter. It will have to perform more than 1,000 hours of work on each of its Max jets before they enter service, it said by email. The largest flight-crew union in North America, the Air Line Pilots Association, called the fixes “sound” in a press release. The union said it is also requesting improvements to FAA’s certification process. In all, there are 72 of the planes in the U.S. and another 315 at airlines in the rest of the world. About 450 additional Max jets were built by Boeing but haven’t been delivered, amounting to billions of dollars in inventory that the company will soon be able to start turning into cash. The European Aviation Safety Agency has said that it is satisfied with the FAA-led review of the Max and is prepared to lift its ban soon. Canada and Brazil, which are also among the world’s leaders in aircraft certification, are also expected to take similar actions. At the insistence of EASA and Canada, Boeing is also working on longer-term fixes to improve the plane’s safety. However, China, the first country to ground the jet and the main driver of growth in the industry, hasn’t given a clear timetable for its return. The impact of the grounding has spread far beyond Boeing and is continuing. The FAA, seen before the crashes as the preeminent aviation regulator, came under heavy criticism by other nations and Congress for its approval of the Max design. As a result of that and other reviews, the agency is in the process of adding layers of new oversight and requirements on planemakers it oversees, such as more thorough assessments of how pilots react during emergencies. The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a measure that would tighten FAA’s authority over employees at Boeing and other manufacturers who are deputized by the agency to sign off on designs, among other reforms. A Senate committee is considering a similar bill on Wednesday. The 737 Max, an update of previous 737 models with more fuel-efficient engines, was grounded in the U.S. on March 13, 2019, three days after the Ethiopian plane went down. Just as in an Oct. 29, 2018, crash on a Lion Air flight in the Java Sea near Jakarta, an automated flight-control feature known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System activated during a malfunction. MCAS, which was designed to nudge the nose down in rare flight conditions, repeatedly dove the planes until pilots lost control. The two crashes killed 346 people. A diver working on the undersea wreckage near Indonesia also died. Boeing and FAA have settled on several changes to MCAS to ensure it can’t cause another crash. The system will only activate once. If it is triggered, its ability to dive is limited so that pilots can still control the plane manually. And, instead of being activated by a single sensor, it will only function if two sensors agree it’s needed. Pilots weren’t initially told that the system existed because Boeing concluded that they could easily disable it using an emergency procedure that had been in place for decades and was required to be memorized at some airlines. However, the underlying sensor failure that triggered MCAS in both cases also prompted confusing additional warnings and loud alerts in the cockpit. The FAA and Boeing had issued instructions for how to handle such a failure after the first accident, yet the Ethiopian crew wasn’t able to do so. Indonesian crash investigators and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board concluded Boeing and the FAA shouldn’t have assumed that pilots would quickly recognize how to respond. In addition to MCAS, the FAA is also requiring numerous other changes to the plane after a torturous review process that at times prompted tension between the planemaker and its overseer, as well as foreign regulators. Regulators required Boeing to complete a complex update to the Max’s flight-control computers so that they are more redundant. Changes were also mandated for the plane’s autopilot and wiring has to be rerouted to limit the risks it could cause a failure similar to what was seen in the crashes. After rags and tools were found in many of the grounded aircraft, the FAA is also ordering inspections to look for such debris left behind during manufacturing. Partially as a result of lapses such as this, the FAA is using its own inspectors to sign off on the safety of newly built planes. It had been routine for Boeing employees to conduct such approvals. Originally one of the chief selling points for the plane was that pilots trained to fly on the previous family of 737s, known as Next Generation, wouldn’t have to complete costly simulator training before transitioning to the Max. Now, every pilot will have to undergo simulator training on the Max, including how to handle issues that arose during the crashes. For Boeing, which faces at least $20 billion in Max-related costs, the crisis became one of the worst in the company’s century-long history. Several senior executives were forced out, including then-CEO Dennis Muilenburg. Now, with the collapse in air travel, airlines that had been clamoring for the more-efficient Boeing jets suddenly are fighting for survival and looking to postpone deliveries. Executives warned last month that the company will burn more cash than it generates until 2022 and that it will take at least a year beyond that to clear the mothballed Max aircraft out of its inventory. “No one needs any jets for growth and the market is going to stay very soft for a number of years,” industry analyst Aboulafia said. How consumers respond to the airplane is also uncertain. John Mowry, managing director with Alton Aviation Consultancy, said the company has begun to refer to the jet by its model number, such as the 737-8, more frequently in press releases -- perhaps a sign that over time the Max brand will eventually go away. “I don’t know if it will be some big, splashy rebranding or if the Max name will just slip into oblivion,” Mowry said in an interview prior to the FAA’s announcement."

The Seoul Central District Court on Tuesday rejected a request to halt a sale of new shares by Korean Air’s parent to state-run Korea Development Bank, a stock issue designed to enable the takeover. The ruling clears the path for the biggest reorganization in South Korea’s airline industry. Airlines have been making record losses this year as travel was all but wiped out after governments closed borders to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Carriers are cutting jobs, selling non-core assets and reducing their networks, with the International Air Transport Association predicting that travel won’t recover to pre-Covid levels until 2024. Korea Development Bank, the main creditor of struggling airline Asiana, said last month that the planned combination of Korean Air and Asiana could collapse if the court rules against the share sale. An unfavorable ruling would have meant that creditors would have to take over Asiana and inject more capital to prevent it from a collapse. The case against the share sale was filed by an alliance of three big holders of Korean Air parent Hanjin Kal Corp., who argued that the stock placement would dilute their stakes and boost Chairman Walter Cho’s sway over the holding company. The alliance, which includes Cho’s sister, is at odds with the chairman and failed with an attempt to oust him this year. “The decision for the new share sale was made on the purpose of acquiring and merging Asiana,” the court said in its ruling. “The court also doesn’t believe Korea Development Bank buying shares in Hanjin Kal will change the shareholding structure as the alliance suggests.” Korean Air and Hanjin respect the court’s decision and will do their best to overcome the current difficult situation, they said in a statement. Heather Cho, the older sister of Walter and best known for the 2014 “nut rage” incident, joined hands with local shareholder activist Korea Corporate Governance Improvement fund and unlisted builder Bando in a bid to put in new management for Hanjin Kal. They own 45.2% of Hanjin Kal combined. The alliance wants Hanjin Kal to focus on its main businesses and sell non-core operations. In response, Hanjin Kal and Korean Air have announced steps to ensure more transparencies in its management and sell units that aren’t essential for the company. The planned 1.8 trillion won ($1.6 billion) acquisition of Asiana by Korean Air, announced last month, is an attempt by Hanjin to stabilize South Korea’s aviation industry amid the pandemic. The parent said it expected Korean Air to be ranked as one of the world’s top 10 airlines once the deal is completed. The attempted deal comes after Kumho Industrial Co. failed in September to sell its entire stake in Asiana to HDC Hyundai Development Co. In July, South Korea’s biggest budget carrier Jeju Air Co. dropped plans to buy Eastar Jet. Heather Cho gained notoriety six years ago -- and spent five months in jail -- after she forced a Korean Air plane to return to the gate in New York because she was angry over the way she’d been served macadamia nuts. The incident spawned the label “nut rage” and made headlines around the world."

Korean Air Lines Co. provided some rare positive news for the devastated global aviation industry Thursday, reporting a quarterly profit after flying planes loaded with products from South Korean technology giants to homebound consumers around the world. The carrier’s operating profit was 148.5 billion won ($125 million) for the April-June period. Cargo sales climbed 95% from a year earlier to 1.23 trillion won. Asiana Airlines Inc. could follow suit with an operating profit of 43.7 billion won when it reports next week, according to the average estimate of analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The profit comes as other airlines are reporting record losses; slashing routes, jobs and salaries; or collapsing altogether because of the impact Covid-19 has had on travel. The crisis has forced some carriers to retrofit their planes to haul more cargo and generate much-needed cash from surging airfreight rates. “The cargo business has come to the rescue yet again when things are going bad,” said Um Kyung-a, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. “Countries will be in need of goods to restart their economies as many emerge from shutdowns due to the outbreak.” Hedge-fund manager David Einhorn is on board, telling investors he bought a stake in Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. in the second quarter because he expects the cargo carrier to benefit from a shortage of airfreight capacity. Korean Air and Asiana benefit from enormous demand for smartphones, TVs and components from Samsung Electronics Co. and memory chips from SK Hynix Inc., said Bang Min-jin, an analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. South Korea’s overseas shipments of semiconductors, its biggest export, rose 2.9% in June from May, while mobile equipment jumped 20%, according to the Ministry of Trade, Energy and Industry. Samsung and LG Electronics Inc. both beat earnings estimates for the quarter ending June, as did Hynix, which said profit tripled after clients snapped up its products to meet demand from people locked down at home. Online commerce is booming: United Parcel Service Inc. posted its biggest one-day share gain in 20 years last week after beating earnings estimates, while Amazon.com Inc. posted a record profit and 40% jump in sales. Korean Air and Asiana have strengthened cargo networks from Vietnam to transport gadgets made at Samsung and LG factories there, Um said. There’s also been strong demand for medical supplies, fresh fruit and seafood, she said. Falling fuel prices helped drive down expenses, with every dollar adjustment impacting earnings by $33 million, according to Korean Air. The increase in airfreight rates came as capacity was squeezed by the grounding of thousands of passenger planes, which carry cargo in their bellies. At the end of July, about 35% of the world’s passenger aircraft were still parked in storage, aviation analytics company Cirium said."

Futures in New York ended the session less than 1% lower on Monday, erasing an earlier rally. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is preparing to extend pandemic restrictions for up to four weeks due to a surge in the delta variant. Meanwhile, investors are also awaiting signals from the Federal Reserve about a timetable for scaling back emergency monetary stimulus that may affect the price of the dollar, and therefore, the price of crude. “The fact that the U.K. has to push back things four weeks is a little bit concerning for that whole robust finish to a strong European summer,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. U.S. crude futures have surged about 8% so far this month as air travel and road traffic picks up in parts of the world like the U.S. and Europe amid an acceleration in Covid-19 vaccination programs. In the U.S., daily air travelers topped 2 million for the first time since the pandemic began. Speculators are the most bullish on the U.S. crude benchmark in about three years. However, technical indicators are showing crude oil in overbought territory, supporting a pullback. WTI’s 14-day Relative Strength Index climbed above 70 for the first time since March. Oil futures rallied early in the session on fading prospects of a quick return of Iranian crude supply with negotiations around the 2015 nuclear deal stalled. Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi cast doubt over the weekend on the chances of reviving the nuclear deal before national elections on June 18. Chances of a deal that invites Iranian crude back into the market are not zero, though. On Monday, Germany’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Andrea Sasse said all delegations had “willingness and seriousness” to solve complex issues in the negotiations. West Texas Intermediate for July delivery fell 3 cents to settle at $70.88 a barrel in New York Brent for August settlement rose 17 cents to end the session at $72.86 a barrel Commodity investors will have their eyes fixed firmly on the Federal Reserve and China this week for clues on whether the year’s powerful rally has more room to run. As trading got under way, WTI crude hit a 32-month high but copper eased below $10,000 a ton, and gold gave up ground. Iraq, OPEC’s second-biggest oil producer, said crude will trade between $68 to $75 a barrel in the second half.

The carrier is marketing two $2.5 billion series of notes maturing in 2026 and 2029, and a term loan credit facility of the same amount due in 2028, according to a news release. The new debt, which is secured against the company’s loyalty program, will help refinance American’s $7.5 billion Treasury loan, of which $550 million has been drawn to date, according to an investor presentation Monday. Early pricing discussions are in the low-to-mid 6% range for the five-year notes, and the mid-to-high 6% range for the eight-year portion, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing a private transaction. Initial pricing on the loan is being discussed at a spread of 500 to 525 basis points over the London interbank offered rate, plus an original issue discount of 98 cents on the dollar with a 1% Libor floor, the people added. American opted to refinance the Treasury loan with debt in an amortizing structure, which allows the company to pay back it in pieces leading up to maturity rather than all at once. The new financing gives American greater flexibility and also potentially increases the borrowing capacity of the AAdvantage program, a company spokesman said. The airline is returning to the market at a ripe time for borrowers: Funding costs are at historically low levels and risk appetite has been soaring as investors rush to get their hands on higher-paying assets. American borrowed $2.5 billion in June at an all-in yield of 12%. Barclays Plc is leading the loan deal and held a call with potential lenders earlier on Monday. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which is leading the bond sale, was sounding out potential investors earlier this year for the deal, Bloomberg reported in February, after helping United Airlines Holdings Inc. with a similar debt offering in June. Representatives for Barclays and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The bond sale is in marketing through March 10 and expected to price thereafter. American’s AAdvantage loyalty program has an assessed value of $18 billion to $30 billion, the carrier said in May, when it was negotiating with the Treasury Department to use at least part of the asset as collateral for the loan. The carrier mortgaged its brand with $1.2 billion in committed financing from Goldman Sachs in July. American has about $3.6 billion in unencumbered assets and additional first lien debt capacity of $7.2 billion, according to the presentation. It said its overall cost of debt is around 4% and has an estimated $15 billion of liquidity. Fitch Ratings rates the new debt BB with a negative outlook. It downgraded American’s secured debt rating one notch to B, five steps below investment grade, as a growing amount of such borrowings may dilute recovery prospects in a distress scenario, according to a report Monday. Fitch removed the company from negative watch given bolstered liquidity and a vaccine rollout that will likely increase air travel. Other airlines have also been raising debt to help repay Covid-19 rescue funds and loans. Deutsche Lufthansa AG sold $1.9 billion of bonds in February to partially repay a state aid package, while United borrowed $3 billion in October to repay $2.75 billion of debt that it sold last year."

European leaders will discuss possible sanctions after Belarus ordered a Ryanair jet to land.  Source: Bloomberg) The outrageous and illegal behaviour of the regime in Belarus will have consequences.Those responsible for the #Ryanair hijacking must be sanctioned. Journalist Roman Protasevich must be released immediately.EUCO will discuss tomorrow action to take. Europe’s fury was triggered after a Boeing Co. 737-800 carrying scores of passengers from Athens to Vilnius was diverted to the Belarusian capital on Sunday under the escort of a Mig-29 fighter jet. The plane’s crew was notified by authorities in Minsk of a “potential security threat on board,” a Ryanair spokeswoman said. Once in Minsk, authorities arrested a journalist who covered protests against President Alexander Lukashenko, whose election to a sixth term last year was internationally disputed. Authorities boarded the plane and arrested Pratasevich, the former editor-in-chief of one the most popular Telegram news channels in Belarus. Pratasevich wasn’t on the plane when it was allowed to take off again for Vilnius, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said in a recorded statement. His girlfriend was searched and allowed back onto the plane, but opted to stay in Minsk. At least four other people also remained in the Belarusian capital, according to Lithuanian officials. Read More: How Belarus Snatched a Dissident Off a Ryanair Plane From Greece “This is a serious and dangerous incident, which requires international investigation,” NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said on Twitter. A spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry in Minsk declined to comment. Potential measures when EU leaders meet could include sanctions against individuals and entities, suspending all flights by EU airlines over Belarus, banning Minsk’s carrier Belavia from landing at airports in the bloc, and the suspension of all transit, including ground travel, between Belarus and the EU, according to an official familiar with the discussions. The steps would be on top of a sanctions package Brussels was already working on and was aiming to present next month. A post-election crackdown by Lukashenko’s administration on the opposition already resulted in U.S. and EU sanctions and pushed the president, in office since 1994, closer to Russia. Sunday’s events risk deepening the international isolation of a country that former U.S. Secretary State of Condoleezza Rice referred to in 2006 during a visit to Lithuania as the last dictatorship in Europe. The latest incident has the potential to influence already strained ties between President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, even as the two leaders move toward a potential first summit as soon as next month. Lukashenko is slated to meet with Putin this week in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Rossiya-1 television reported Sunday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov didn’t respond to a request for comment after hours in Moscow. Roman Pratasevich is detained by police in Minsk, Belarus in March 2017. U.S. State Department officials spoke with officials in Brussels, Vilnius and Athens across Sunday, according to a person familiar with the diplomacy who asked not to be named talking about internal discussions. Lukashenko gave an unconditional order to turn the plane around, the state news service Belta said, citing the unofficial Pool Pervogo telegram channel, which is widely seen as run by people close to the presidential press service. An adviser to Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said Pratasevich, 26, had been bundled off the flight in Minsk by police. “At first he panicked, then calmed down a bit, but still was trembling,” Franak Viacorka said on Twitter, citing passengers. “He said he’ll face the death penalty here. He was taken aside, his belongings dumped on the runway.” Pratasevich and his NEXTA colleague Stsiapan Putsila were accused of organizing mass unrest and group actions severely violating public order, the Investigative Committee said on Nov. 5. They were also accused of stirring “social hatred” against law enforcers via their Telegram channels. Viacorka said that the arrest may also allow the authorities in Belarus to obtain information about Pratasevich’s collaborators, facilitating a broader repression of independent reporting. “They have control over his phone,” he said in a separate phone interview. “They can get access to the channels he administered and to all correspondence and chats Pratasevich had.” Unprecedented event! A civilian passenger plane flying to Vilnius was forcibly landed in #Minsk. Belarusian political activist & founder of @NEXTA_EN was on the plane. He is arrested.  regime is behind the abhorrent action. I demand to free Roman Protasevič urgently! Nauseda called the Ryanair forced landing an unprecedented “kidnapping of a person by use of military force” and urged NATO and the EU to react to the threat posed by the Belarusian leadership to civil aviation. Mateusz Morawiecki, the prime minister of Belarus’s neighbor Poland, urged sanctions against Lukashenko for committing an “act of state terrorism.” Greece called it a “state hijacking.” German Foreign Minister Heiko Mass denounced Belarus’s actions, saying that forcing a plane to land under the pretext of a bomb threat was a “severe interference into civil aviation travel.” “Such an act cannot remain without consequences from the side of the European Union,“ Maas said. There were conflicting reports of the number of people who were on board. The foreign ministries of Greece and Lithuania said there were 171 passengers from at least 18 countries. The Belarusian state news agency Belta reported that there were 123 passengers. Lithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte arrived at the airport in Vilnius with a prosecutor to question the arriving passengers, and the prime minister announced an investigation. U.S. lawmakers joined with counterparts from seven other countries in calling for an inquiry by the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization into a “clear violation of free transit between states and the threats to the aircraft.” “Until ICAO has reported, we call for Belarus to be suspended from the organization and a ban on all overflight of Belarus including flights to and from the country,” Senator Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement. Blinken said the Biden administration supports the earliest possible meeting of the ICAO to review Sunday’s events. “Initial reports suggesting the involvement of the Belarusian security services and the use of Belarusian military aircraft to escort the plane are deeply concerning and require full investigation.” The forced landing drew sharp and unified condemnation from across the European Union, with France and Greece, Poland and Germany among those rushing to express their anger. Further sanctions on Minsk may result. EU leaders due to meet in Brussels for a two-day summit starting Monday will discuss the consequences of what EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called an “unacceptable” action."

One Indian budget carrier is going another way to drum up income -- not flying. SpiceJet Ltd. hasn’t flown any of its Boeing Co. 737 Max jets for more than 27 months, after two deadly crashes operated by other airlines led to a global grounding. While most other major markets apart from China have cleared the Max to fly again, SpiceJet seems in no hurry to get it back in the air, and not just because there’s less demand to use the jet because of the pandemic. India’s second-biggest budget carrier booked other income of 12.3 billion rupees ($165 million) in the eight quarters through March. That was the amount it expected to get in compensation from Boeing for not being able to fly its 13 Max aircraft, helping the company to trim its losses during deeply challenging times. SpiceJet is the only Indian airline that operates the Max. With firm orders for 142 more, it’s also one of its biggest customers globally. Yet the carrier hasn’t asked regulators to lift the flying ban in India, a person familiar with the matter said. There’s no clarity on why it has held back, and it would take at least a month after applying to get approvals in place, the person said, asking not to be identified as the matter is confidential. SpiceJet declined to comment. Boeing said it continues to work closely with aviation regulators in India and elsewhere about returning the Max to service, but doesn’t comment on talks with its customers. In its annual results released late Wednesday, SpiceJet said management was confident of collecting the compensation from Boeing. However, its auditor Walker Chandiok & Co. said there was “no certainty” that the income would be recognized, reiterating a previous stand and that of SpiceJet’s erstwhile auditors.  “SpiceJet is using this accounting method to shore up their results, and obviously to make sure that they don’t need to bring in solvency capital of a magnitude which would dilute the current ownership,” said Shailesh Haribhakti, a chartered accountant and chairman of Shailesh Haribhakti & Associates, adding that such an approach is allowed under Indian regulations. SpiceJet posted a loss of 10 billion rupees, its its third-straight annual loss, in line with what analysts expected. The carrier almost shut down in 2014 after running out of money, only to be rescued by co-founder Ajay Singh, who as chairman has changed its network, renegotiated vendor contracts and diversified into businesses including a dedicated cargo service, retail and health care. On Wednesday, Its board also approved a plan to raise as much as 25 billion rupees by selling shares to institutional investors and to spin off its profitable cargo business.  SpiceJet shares fell 1.5% to 81 rupees Wednesday in Mumbai, before the results were announced. They’ve fallen almost 15% this year, while the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex index has risen 10%.  SpiceJet’s fleet includes other Boeing 737 models and Bombardier Inc. Q400 turboprops, though it isn’t operating near the capacity it was before Covid. The airline carried just 3.9 million passengers in the first five months of 2021 as the outbreak in India worsened, a slump of more than 52% from the same period in 2019. The 737 family has been the backbone of SpiceJet’s fleet all along, with the company previously saying the “highly sophisticated” Max would allow it to compete better and expand profits. While those profits aren’t expected now, the Max -- even when grounded -- might offset some of the pain from last year. “An entity must be allowed to account for a highly anticipated inflow of economic benefit,”said Suvigya Awasthy, a New Delhi-based Associate Partner at PSL Advocates and Solicitors, who specializes in commercial disputes."

Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Las Vegas Sands Corp. will tell vaccinated guests they can stop wearing masks following new guidance from state and federal regulators. That makes the Nevada casino operators among the first companies to amend their masking and social-distancing policies following revised guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. U.S. states including Colorado, Michigan, Kentucky and North Carolina eased their mask mandates on Friday following the CDC recommendations, while Massachusetts said it will update reopening plans next week. The Biden administration will also begin revising its guidance for travel and other sectors, as it linked its mask shift to a study showing the “real world” effectiveness of vaccines. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf said the state is evaluating whether to further lift mask rules, a day after deciding to follow federal guidance easing rules for fully vaccinated people. “We were taken by surprise by the CDC announcement, and as of today, we’re still looking at it,” the Democratic governor said on MSNBC. He said the state is committed to dropping the mask mandate completely when 70% of adults are fully vaccinated -- a goal he said he expects to hit within two months. The state is slated for full reopening, apart from the mask mandate, at the end of May. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has begun preliminary internal discussions about reopening the border with the U.S., even as Canada remains well behind its neighbor in vaccinations. Senior officials have begun to formally talk about options for how to proceed, three people familiar with the matter said, speaking on the condition they not be identified. One question under consideration is whether to employ a two-track system in which quarantine and testing requirements would be relaxed for vaccinated travelers. Colorado dropped mask requirements for people who have been vaccinated against Covid-19, effective immediately, Governor Jared Polis announced at a news conference in Denver. “The pandemic is not yet over but if you are vaccinated it is largely over for you,” Polis said. Mask requirements will remain in place for schools, prisons and motor vehicles agency office until June 1. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai asked Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, about how it will declare the end of a pandemic, according to a statement from her office. They also discussed how to increase vaccine production and access, as well as waiving intellectual property rights on shots. Governor Roy Cooper of North Carolina went beyond the new federal rules for loosening mask requirements and eased masking for everyone, indoors and out, whether or not a person is fully vaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention limited its mask easing to the fully vaccinated. he said mask requirements would remain only in settings like schools, public transportation and prisons. “This is a big step forward, in living our lives the way they were before the pandemic,” the Democratic governor said in a news conference, according to the New & Observer. Mexico City is considering shutting down temporary Covid-19 hospitals as cases continue to decline in the country’s capital, Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said on Friday. Mexico City’s excess mortality was 832 in April, compared to over 14,000 recorded in January. As of Thursday, the city reported 17 Covid-19 deaths. Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Las Vegas Sands Corp., two Nevada casino operators, will tell vaccinated guests they can stop wearing masks, following new guidance from state and federal regulators. Wynn plans to begin delivering that message to customers Friday evening, trusting guests to take the appropriate precautions based on their personal vaccination status, according to a statement. Sands said that while it won’t ask vaccinated patrons to wear masks, it is still requiring staff to do so for now. MGM Resorts International, the largest casino operator on the Las Vegas Strip, is expected to update its policy shortly. The companies are among the first to amend their masking and social-distancing policies following the revised guidance Thursday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency said vaccinated persons could stop wearing masks both indoors and out in almost all circumstances. Portugal will deliver 24,000 doses of vaccines to the African island nation of Cape Verde Friday night, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The move came after the government of Cape Verde asked for help to fight the spread of the pandemic in the country. It’s also part of Portugal’s commitment to provide 5% of its vaccines to Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa, as well as to East Timor in Asia, the ministry said. The Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine and the Moderna Inc. shot were 94% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 in a real-world study of health-care workers that was key to the federal decision to ease restrictions for fully vaccinated people. “This report provided the most compelling information to date that Covid-19 vaccines were performing as expected in the real world,” Rochelle Walensky, head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a statement. Rising cases of the India variant of coronavirus could force the U.K. government to delay plans to end the pandemic lockdown, Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned. Speaking in London, the premier announced the government will speed up second doses of vaccines for the over-50s and for vulnerable groups in an effort to combat the new strain. The gap between first and second doses will be cut to eight weeks from 12 for these groups, he said. “I have to level with you that this new variant could pose a serious disruption to our progress,” Johnson said at a press conference. It could be “more difficult” to move to the final phase of lockdown easing on June 21, he said. Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty said: “We expect over time that this variant will come to take over and to dominate in the U.K.” Germany returned the U.K. to its list of Covid-19 risk areas, widening the impact of Britain’s rise in cases linked to the so-called India variant. The change, which takes effect Sunday, is due to the “at least limited occurrence” of the B.1.617.2 variant first detected in India, Germany’s public health authority Robert Koch Institute said in a statement on Friday. Michigan and Kentucky said Friday they would adopt the new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on easing mask wearing for fully vaccinated people. Roughly half a dozen other states have they would begin to lift mandates in accordance with the CDC guidance. “We can now safely and confidently take the next step to get back to normal,” Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement. Governor Andy Beshear announced that Kentucky would lift all remaining capacity restrictions on businesses and events on June 11. Delta Air Lines Inc. will require that new hires be vaccinated against Covid-19, aiming to protect employees and customers as demand for domestic air travel continues to climb. The carrier has “made great progress to achieve herd immunity,” a trajectory it wants to maintain with the new standard, Delta said Friday. Vaccination isn’t required for current workers, though more than 60% of its workforce has received shots. Governor Charlie Baker said Massachusetts will update its reopening plans next week, following the U.S. Centers for Disease Control relaxing of mask rules for fully vaccinated people. He tweeted Friday that the change was “great news,” though his office said the day before that the state’s mask rules would remain in place for the time being. His current reopening plan calls for higher capacity limits for restaurants and gatherings at the end of this month and the lifting of most other restrictions by August. Massachusetts has the second-highest rate of vaccinations in the U.S. after Vermont, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. The Biden administration will begin updating its guidance for travel and other sectors -- likely further relaxing rules across the U.S. after largely lifting its mask mandate for vaccinated people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Thursday that fully vaccinated people could go without a mask in most settings, even indoors in large crowds, in what was a key milestone in the U.S. path out of the pandemic. Other steps will follow. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Friday that the agency would update guidance for travel, schools and other things, and the White House is signaling to government agencies that they also can loosen mask rules. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga added three more prefectures to a coronavirus state of emergency, as his government tackles a surge in infections just over two months before Tokyo hosts the Olympics. The emergency status, which currently includes Tokyo and other major metro areas, will be expanded to the northern island of Hokkaido as well as Hiroshima and Okayama prefectures. It will be effective May 16 through the end of the month. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked villagers in the world’s second-most populous nation to take precautions as the coronavirus spreads rapidly in rural areas. India has reported more than 300,000 daily infections for 22 consecutive days, highlighting the country’s slide into the world’s worst health crisis. The Covid crisis is also threatening operations at some of its biggest ports, raising concern the action could trigger shipping delays that reverberate through global supply chains. Rising cases of the India variant of coronavirus could force the U.K. government to delay plans to end the pandemic lockdown, Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned. England’s chief medical officer said he expects the strain will become dominant there. Subscribe to a daily update on the virus from Bloomberg’s Prognosis team here.

The CDC’s relaxed mask-wearing guidance is open to revision, particularly if there are local outbreaks or if gathering in relatively sparse crowds is found to cause an increase in cases, National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins said. “If it looks in certain communities the virus is coming back, or if there’s a new variant that seems particularly contagious, then we may need to adjust that,” Collins said on MSNBC. Even so, “it’s time to take that chance, as they have now done, and to see if all of us can get a little closer back to normal life,” he said. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy is leaving the state’s indoor mask mandate in place for public settings, according to a tweet. “We’re making incredible progress, but we’re not there yet.” Among all U.S. states, New Jersey, the most densely populated, has the fourth-lowest case count per capita, he wrote. Republicans -- who, like Murphy, are running for re-election in November -- criticized the governor. “According to the CDC, the science doesn’t support waiting weeks -- it supports lifting unjustified mandates today,” Assemblywoman Holly Schepisi, a River Vale Republican seeking a Senate seat, said in a statement.

It’s a difficult time to be running an airline anywhere. For Michael Rousseau, the incoming chief executive officer of Air Canada, the job comes with a unique set of complications. Air travel in Canada hasn’t even begun to bounce back from the Covid-19 crisis. Passenger traffic at airport checkpoints in January was just 13% of last year’s levels, versus 38% in the U.S., according to data from the countries’ transportation authorities. The situation for airlines is getting worse, even though virus cases are dropping. Source: Air Canada An Air Canada plane sits parked at Toronto’s Pearson International Airport. A rebound is nowhere in sight. The government of Justin Trudeau, which barred most foreign travelers from entering the country last March, just made the rules even tougher. It’s also explicitly telling Canadians not to leave. In the first week of February, air travel was less than 9% of year-earlier levels. The government has offered no dedicated aid package for airlines. The result has been deep cuts across the industry. Air Canada has furloughed or dismissed more than 20,000 workers and used loans, equity offerings and aircraft sale-leaseback deals to raise billions of dollars. The challenge for Rousseau, who starts in the top job Monday after more than 13 years as chief financial officer, will be to balance cash-preservation with the ability to meet rising demand once travel restrictions are relaxed, said Dan Fong, an analyst at Veritas Investment Research Corp. “They’ve been very effective in the past at scaling up and scaling down,” he said. “The key, though, will be beyond the pandemic, because if you cut too deeply you’ll have a tougher time participating in the recovery.” Hopes raised by the arrival of vaccines late last year have been dashed by the discovery of more-infectious strains, which prompted countries to tighten borders. The slow pace of vaccination is another impediment, pushing prospects for a global travel recovery to 2022. In its worst-case scenario, the International Air Transport Association now sees passenger traffic improving by only 13% in 2021 compared with 2020, when it fell by almost two-thirds from 2019 levels. Brace Yourself: Long-Haul Travel Might Not Start Until 2023 Rousseau is following a tough act. Under departing CEO Calin Rovinescu, a lawyer who spent almost 12 years in the job, Air Canada expanded its network, adding direct international flights on routes with little or no competition, according to Fong. Labor relations improved, giving the airline operating flexibility, he said. By preventing a trip to bankruptcy court in 2009, Rovinescu also set the stage for huge gains for investors. In the decade that ended Dec. 31, 2019, Air Canada shares gained 3,575%, making it the top-performing stock in the S&P/TSX Composite Index. They collapsed during the pandemic but have more than doubled from a March low. Air Canada has curtailed operations more drastically than have its U.S. rivals, which enjoy a larger domestic market and received government money to cover payroll costs, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst George Ferguson. “They’ve not been supported by the Canadian government to date very much, so the way they’ve knocked down their cash burn is by letting go a bunch of people, cutting a bunch of stations,” Ferguson said. “Canada at some point needs to figure out what they want from their most important airline.” Making things worse is Canada’s slow vaccine rollout, which could hurt reservations for the peak summer season. The country has administered just 3.1 doses per 100 people, versus 14 per 100 in the U.S., according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. Analysts expect an 80% decline in revenue when Air Canada reports fourth-quarter earnings on Friday. A key metric to watch is how much cash the company anticipates it will burn, after an expected C$12 million ($9.5 million) to C$14 million a day in the fourth quarter. Air Canada has built up enough liquidity to hunker down for several more quarters. National Bank Financial analyst Cameron Doerksen estimates that the airline ended 2020 with about C$8.2 billion in cash and will hit a low of C$4.1 billion in the first quarter of 2022. That kind of cushion helped Air Canada stay away from an emergency loan program for large businesses, which comes at a high cost and has been tapped by only one small airline so far. Air Canada has received some help from Ottawa in the form of a federal wage subsidy program, which helped reduce operating expenses by a net C$391 million for the first nine months of 2020, filings show. Trudeau and his ministers have pledged to support the airline industry, but additional funding will probably come with conditions. The government’s priorities are to ensure airlines give refunds for canceled flights, reinstate suspended regional routes in Canada and protect jobs, Katherine Cuplinskas, a spokeswoman for Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, said by email. The government is right to not “mindlessly bail out” the industry, said Ambarish Chandra, a professor of economic analysis and policy at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. It could also take an equity stake, like Germany and other nations did with some of their airlines, he said. Rovinescu has said he opposes such aid. “Air Canada has deep pockets, very profitable routes, it has a very strong brand name,” Chandra said. “If they really want a bailout, they should give the government something in return.”"

And American plans to hire 800 new flight attendants by next March, according to an airline executive. The moves are the latest indication that leisure travel in the U.S. is recovering more quickly from the pandemic than airlines expected. “Increasing customer demand and new routes starting later this year mean we need more flight attendants to operate the airline,” Brady Byrnes, the airline's vice president of flight service, told flight attendants in a memo Thursday. Byrnes said cabin crews who are coming back from leave will return to flights in November or December. Last year, American offered long-term leaves of absence to flight attendants and other employees to cut costs while it struggled with a steep drop in travel caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Other airlines did the same thing. Now they need people. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said this week that his airline expects to hire between 4,000 and 5,000 workers this year. Delta plans to add 1,300 reservations agents by this fall to reduce long waits on hold for customers who call the airline. It's also adding customer service, cargo and airport workers and plans to hire more than 1,000 pilots before next summer. When the pandemic hit, the number of people flying in the U.S. plunged below 100,000 on some days, a level not seen in decades. This year, it has climbed from less than 700,000 a day in early February to 2 million a day in July."

A rebound in trips to visit friends and family coupled with flight schedules that remain below 2019 levels means more flyers chasing fewer seats. That’s pushing up trip costs for the peak summer season as carriers reboot revenue management tools -- which raise fares in line with stronger seat demand -- after a year in which planes often flew with rows of empty seats. A worker closes the door on an American Airlines plane at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York in March. Travelers at a United Airlines check-in counter at San Francisco International Airport earlier in May. “I haven’t been super pleased with the prices,” said Jackson Ralston, 29 years old, of Lake Dallas, Texas, who is monitoring daily Google Flight fare alerts to attend a friend’s bachelor party this summer. Current ticket prices from Dallas to Manchester, New Hampshire, for the planned weekend at a lake are close to $600. “I’m debating whether or not I’ll need to fly into more of a major hub over there and just rent a car and drive up,” he said. The hit to consumer wallets is buoying airlines that have had to rely on billions of dollars in federal aid to weather a collapse in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Coupled with deep cost cuts last year, the fare recovery is making carriers including Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. more confident that their run of red ink will end in the third quarter. Airfares jumped a record 10.2% in April from the previous month, reflecting a surge of demand as cooped-up consumers returned to the skies. After falling in January as the pandemic reached some of its worst levels in the U.S., airline traffic has more than doubled. In the past week, an average of almost 1.7 million people took flights each day, including 1.86 million on Sunday, a new post-pandemic record, according to Transportation Security Administration data. Passenger levels were still 30% below the same period in May 2019. Compared with the level in the first quarter, the median round-trip fare has climbed 12% to $357.36, according to TripActions Inc., a corporate travel manager that collects fares from global ticket-distribution systems. Those three months are a rough proxy for the U.S. summer buying season as people plan vacations and weekend trips. The price increases are likely to stick, making the ultra-low fares of a year ago a distant memory. In the U.S. domestic market, fares will average $283 for June through August, a 35% increase from a year earlier and only 4% below the summer of 2019, according to a May 18 fare forecast from Hopper Inc., a travel search and analytics company. “In the domestic market, I expect that fares will meet those of 2019 levels” sometime between August and October, said Adit Damodaran, an economist with Montreal-based Hopper. Billions of dollars in federal aid kept airlines afloat last year while requiring them to maintain certain service levels. As a result, the seat supply didn’t fall as quickly as demand. In late March 2020, with would-be flyers staying home en masse, airlines offered some flights between New York and the West Coast for as little as $88, down 51% from earlier in the month, according to Hopper. Now the airlines are making up for lost time by seizing on consumer appetites for leisure trips, primarily for domestic flights and popular Caribbean and Latin American beach destinations. Canada and most of Europe remain largely off limits to leisure travelers, with lengthly mandatory quarantine protocols for inbound visitors. Industry executives see a recovery in Asian travel as even further behind. To adjust, airlines are shifting some of their largest twin-aisle aircraft to domestic routes that were served largely by smaller planes before the pandemic. The three largest U.S. airlines have increased wide-body flights in the U.S. by 30% this year through August, with numbers peaking in June and July, from 2019, according to data from Cirium. American Airlines Group Inc. is using big Boeing Co. 777 jets on flights connecting Miami with Los Angeles and New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport. There’s still a ways to go before pricing fully catches up with the levels of 2019, a record year for air travel. Domestic leisure fares this quarter are roughly 18% below the same period two years ago, according to data compiled for Bloomberg News by TripActions. Relative to 2019, ticket prices can vary widely by route. The median price for a round-trip ticket from Minneapolis to Orlando, home of Disney and Universal theme parks, is $304.68 this quarter, down 28% from two years ago, according to TripActions. Los Angeles to Orlando is 12% lower. But New York to Miami fares are 39% higher, at $487. The improving outlook for pricing power has helped spur a rally in a Standard & Poor’s index of major U.S. airlines, which has advanced 30% this year. The index rose to a six-week high Wednesday after recent signs that the recovery was strengthening. Booked fares on June flights are nearing the same level as two years ago, Southwest Airlines Co. said May 19, spurred partially by the carrier’s plan to fly only 84% of its 2019-level capacity in the second quarter. Likewise, while United is touting July as its busiest flight schedule since March 2020, the month’s flying will still be about 20% below the level of two years ago. United is flying 126 new routes in July it didn’t have two years ago, a sign of what the airline and its competitors have done to revamp their networks and pursue leisure traffic destinations near and far. Delta’s bookings have been better than expected recently as customers resume booking trips further in advance, said Glen Hauenstein, the company’s president. Forward bookings are above 2019 levels for leisure travel, he told a Wolfe Research conference May 25. “July is better than June, and August is better than July,” Hauenstein said. “September is better than August.”"

That’s the message from the International Air Transport Association’s chief medical adviser, David Powell. On top of face masks, regular hand washing and sanitizing of high-touch surfaces, carriers should work with regulators to introduce reliable coronavirus testing systems for passengers before they board in order to get people back on planes. “The ideal protection is to avoid people who are infectious,” Powell said in an interview with Bloomberg News. “We need a test that’s reliable and fast enough and that’s able to be done in huge numbers.” Right now, that’s a tall order. Manfacturers globally are struggling to meet Covid-19 test-kit demand. And the multiple tests that do exist can often sow more confusion than certainty. Just last month a spat erupted between Singapore and China after the latter found infectious passengers on a flight from the island nation. Singapore said most of the people in question had recovered but “may continue to shed viral fragments for weeks or even months” leading to a positive test result. With almost no one traveling for business or leisure, airlines are doing everything they can to avoid collapse. IATA, which represents 290 carriers globally, has said it doesn’t see passenger traffic recovering until at least 2024, and it expects airlines to lose more than $84 billion this year alone. As scientists’ understanding of SARS-CoV-2 develops, the medical profession’s stance has shifted. In early February, when Covid-19 was still a big question mark in most people’s minds, Powell said the best way to avoid infection was frequent hand washing rather than wearing a mask. By May, the recommendation on face coverings was universal. “We recognize that a percentage of Covid cases can be asymptomatic,” Powell said earlier this week. “That’s the reason for that change in position.”"

The shot was cleared for use Saturday as the third vaccine available in the country. Anthony Fauci pushed back against any tendency to shop around or wait for a preferred vaccine among the three that are now approved for use in the U.S. The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases was asked on ABC’s “This Week” about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which got the go-ahead on Saturday from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The one-dose J&J shot was found to be highly effective at preventing severe Covid-19, but has a lower efficacy rate than the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc. vaccines, raising concerns that some people may opt to wait rather than being vaccinated with it. “We’ve got to get away from that chain of thought,” Fauci said on ABC. Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine should be used to inoculate U.S. adults 18 years old and older, advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a 12-0 vote. The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices held an emergency meeting Sunday to review J&J’s shot, which the Food and Drug Administration cleared late Saturday. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky must now sign off on the recommendation from the panel of independent doctors and immunization experts. J&J’s vaccine can be administered once the CDC finalizes its guidelines. The first doses will soon be distributed, becoming the third Covid-19 vaccine available in the U.S. South Carolina’s restrictions will ease Monday. Alcohol sales in bars and restaurants will no longer be banned after 11 p.m., and events involving more than 250 people will no longer require state approval. The state never had a mask mandate, which Governor Henry McMaster called unenforceable. The state is, however, recommending that masks still be worn and other health and social-distancing measures be observed. “The virus is still among us and we all must continue to make responsible decisions to take care of ourselves and our loved ones,” the Republican governor tweeted after announcing the rollback. “But those decisions are for South Carolinians to make.” South Carolina is one of 16 states where new cases are declining even as some other states report increases, according to the Covid Tracking Project. California reported 158 deaths yesterday, the lowest since Feb. 15 and below the 14-day average of 367, according to the health department’s website. The state has reported 51,979 fatalities in total. There were 4,685 new cases, below the average of 5,406. California’s 14-day positive test rate dropped to 2.7%, the lowest since Oct. 20. The state has administered almost 48.5 million tests in total. Widely-used Microsoft Corp. vaccine scheduling software that has run into difficulties in states like Iowa and New Jersey is being blamed for problems that left some residents of the nation’s capital unable to book appointments. After three straight days of issues with the District of Columbia’s online vaccination registration, the Redmond, Washington-based technology company released a statement along with the city government acknowledging “that our efforts have fallen short” and vowing to address the problems. France reported on Sunday 19,952 new cases in 24 hours, a low number compared to previous days, though weekend reporting is often incomplete. This comes against a background of tighter restrictions in several parts of the country, such as local lockdowns over the weekends, due to the spread of variants, and as the government is reluctant to impose a third nationwide confinement. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa eased restrictions as the rate of new infections dropped, scrapping most limits on alcohol sales, shortening a nighttime curfew and permitting larger public gatherings. The move to virus alert level 1, from level 3, comes a year after the first Covid-19 case was detected in the country, and will remove most remaining shackles on the struggling economy, Ramaphosa said in a televised address to the nation on Sunday.The average daily number of new coronavirus cases in South Africa has dropped to less than 1,500, from a peak of about 22,000 in early January. Six cases of a Brazilian coronavirus variant have been detected in the U.K., Public Health England said, warning the mutation may be more resistant to vaccines. Two cases in England are from the same household in Gloucestershire with a history of travel to Brazil, while a third is unlinked, PHE said on Sunday in an emailed statement. Another three have been detected in Scotland, it said. Norwegian capital Oslo will close restaurants and shops from Monday to curb an acceleration of new cases caused by virus strains, especially the one first found in the U.K. Exceptions will be allowed for pharmacies, groceries and take-away meals. Norway has fared better during the pandemic than many other countries, including its neighbor Sweden. Still, cases in the capital have increased by about 50% in four days following a recent winter school break. The restrictions will be in place until March 15. Germany’s STIKO health authority will soon reconsider its decision not to recommend the AstraZeneca vaccine for people over 65. “There will be a new updated recommendation very soon,” head of STIKO Thomas Mertens told ZDF television late on Saturday. Last month, Germany decided to keep it’s recommendation for the vaccine to only be administered to people aged 18-64, saying there was no sufficient data for effectiveness for 65 and above. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Governor Andrew Cuomo should be stripped of his emergency powers, following accusations of sexual harassment and improper counting of deaths at nursing homes. The mayor said New York’s legislature “must immediately revoke the Governor’s emergency powers that overrule local control.” “Questions of this magnitude cannot hang over the heads of New Yorkers as we fight off a pandemic and economic crisis,” de Blasio said in a statement Sunday. “It’s clear what must now take place.” The two Democrats have become political adversaries, sparring frequently over decisions during the pandemic. At the start of the outbreak in New York, Cuomo said de Blasio did not have the authority to declare city schools shut for the academic year. Senegal will take delivery of its first tranche of 324,000 doses of vaccines offered under the Covax initiative on March 3, Mamadou Ndiaye, spokesperson for the nation’s Ministry of Health, said today by phone. Ghana last week became the first country to receive the vaccines through the World Health Organization-backed program, which aims to provide at least 2 billion doses to lower-income countries. Italy will tighten curbs in Milan, Turin and other areas starting Monday to counter an acceleration of the virus caused by new variants, particularly the strain first found in the U.K. People in designated medium-risk and high-risk areas, known as orange and red zones, will be barred from leaving their city or town except for work or emergency reasons. Some areas will also close schools. The country reported 17,455 new cases on Sunday and 192 daily deaths versus 280 the day before. South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem defended her decision not to require business closures or other health measures to stop the spread of coronavirus in her state. South Dakota has had one of worst rates for Covid-19 deaths and infections in the country, though the virus is now on the retreat. “We allowed people to make decisions for themselves,” the Republican governor said in an interview on CBS News’ “Face the Nation.” She said that keeping children in school and making sure people can work and “pay their bills” are among her top priorities. The U.K. said it had administered more than 20 million first doses of vaccine, with almost 800,000 also receiving a second inoculation. The country added just over 6,000 new cases on Sunday, the lowest since September and down from a peak of more than 60,000 in early January. Another 144 people died after testing positive. Both figures are lower on weekends due to reporting delays. The U.S. set records over the last two days for vaccinations, the drive now recovered after extreme winter weather paralyzed parts of the nation, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. On Saturday, 2.4 million doses were administered, and on Friday, 2.2 million. Before the storms, doses peaked at 2 million a day on Feb. 12 and 13, the tracker shows. In total, 72.8 million doses have been given in the U.S., with an average over the last week at 1.65 million a day. The Czech Republic won’t wait for the European Union regulator’s approval to use a Russian coronavirus vaccine, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said. The country has taken “concrete steps” to purchase the Sputnik V vaccine and will use it if Czech health authorities approve, Babis said on Sunday in a weekly debate show on Prima TV. Local drug authorities’ assessment of the safety of the vaccine “would be sufficient” to use the shots, he said. London’s Heathrow airport will charge departing passengers an extra 8.90 pounds ($12.40) in an effort to claw back costs as the coronavirus crisis depresses air travel. Heathrow has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic since it relies on long-haul markets that have been all-but wiped out. The airport last week posted a 2 billion-pound loss for 2020 after passenger numbers tumbled 73%, a decline it says has left it unable to cover the costs of providing some services. Reported U.S. cases declined on Saturday to 68,049, a daily total that’s little changed from the previous seven-day average, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg. The U.S. added 1,536 deaths, the fewest since Monday, according to the data. The Czech Republic, which is fighting one the world’s worst outbreaks, reported 7,798 new cases in the 24 hours through Saturday, its highest weekend number since Jan. 9. The government on Friday announced the strictest measures it has imposed since the beginning of the pandemic, including limits on travel between counties and closure of shops, all schools and preschools. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, pushed back against any tendency to shop around or wait for a preferred vaccine. Microsoft Corp. vowed to fix widespread problems with its vaccine scheduling software.

Minneapolis-based Sun Country’s shares, which opened trading at $33 Wednesday, closed at $36.38 in New York trading, giving the company a market value of about $2 billion. Sun Country sold about 9.1 million shares on Tuesday for $24 each after marketing them for $21 to $23. Apollo Global Management Inc. acquired the airline in 2018 and an Apollo affiliate will continue to control the company after the IPO, according to Sun Country’s filings. The airline specializes in ferrying Midwesterners to vacation destinations such as Florida, as well as those in Latin America and the Caribbean. The company said its growth depends on a return to normal business conditions after the pandemic, which remains a threat. Sun Country “absolutely” timed its IPO to take advantage of the expected surge in domestic travel as more people are vaccinated against Covid-19 and cases of the virus decline, Chief Executive Officer Jude Bricker said in an interview. U.S. airlines have seen a recent pickup in bookings for summer travel and fares after a year of depressed demand, possible early signs that a recovery has begun, industry executives said at a conference Monday. “We’re moving from getting through last year to growing the airline again, particularly the passenger business, so that need intersects with pretty receptive equity markets right now for airlines and related rebound stocks,” Sun Country Chief Financial Officer Dave Davis said in the interview. “It made perfect sense to take advantage of it now and get some cash on the balance sheet.” Sun Country had a net loss of $3.9 million on revenue of $401 million last year, compared with net income of $46 million on revenue of $701 million in 2019, according to its filings. The airline will use $45 million of the proceeds to repay a federal loan under the CARES Act, the only incremental debt it took on during the pandemic. “We’re coming through this with a better balance sheet than when we went into it, which I think has got to be unique in the airline industry,” Davis said. The last U.S. airline IPO was by Mesa Air Group Inc. in 2018. This month, U.S. carrier, Frontier Group Holdings Inc., revived its plans for an IPO. Frontier, which hasn’t set terms for the offering, withdrew its earlier IPO plan in July as passenger traffic dived during the pandemic. Frontier swung from net income of $251 million in 2019 to a loss of $225 million last year, according to its filings. The planned starts this year of two discount airlines -- Breeze Aviation Group Inc. and Avelo Airlines -- and the expansion of Southwest Airlines Co. don’t represent troublesome competition for Sun Country, Bricker said, because they primarily will serve different markets and customers. Sun Country also plans to expand its nascent cargo business. Sun Country, which flies used Boeing Co. 737-800s, won’t buy more aircraft until prices decline, Davis said. It’s held talks off and on for about three years with Boeing, including a possible purchase of 737 Max planes that have lost their buyers. So far they “haven’t been at the right price,” Davis said. Sun Country’s offering was led by Barclays Plc, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank AG. The shares are trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol SNCY."

The Frantic Pitch to Save Summer,"['Layan Odeh', 'Siddharth Vikram Philip']",Business,"Airplane landing at Heathrow Airport. The effort to save Europe’s travel industry has devolved into an increasingly desperate race against the clock. With June just one week away, there’s little time left to ignite the summer travel boom that airlines, hotels and tourist-dependent economies are counting on to reverse a year-long booking drought. Yet borders are opening slowly, prompting a furious lobbying campaign to persuade health authorities that flying is safe. The most intense action involves the U.K.’s green list of countries to which travel is allowed without quarantine upon return. In the first week of June, the government is due to update its traffic-light system established on May 7, and airlines and governments alike want it to be rapidly expanded. Greece and Spain have lobbied hard to move up from amber to join Portugal, now alone among significant green-listed destinations. The United Arab Emirates, home to long-distance hubs in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, wants off of the red list, where it sits despite relatively low infection rates. Airlines stand ready to transport Brits to Mykonos, the Costa Brava and other destinations both east and west.  “I don't think the U.K. aviation industry can go through another lost summer without grave consequences,’’  EasyJet Plc Chief Executive Officer Johan Lundgren said Wednesday at a press conference hosted by lobby group Airlines U.K. Should official restrictions make it impossible to operate this summer, “the government needs to be ready and prepared to step up to protect this industry,” he said.  Lundgren and others argue that the U.K.’s rapid vaccine rollout has provided enough protection to open up at a faster pace, and allow vaccinated people to  travel freely, as the European Union is preparing to do next month. Yet the government, battling a surge of Covid-19 cases caused by a variant first detected in India, has remained cautious. Germany shut its doors to British leisure travelers, citing the dangers of the fast-spreading strain, while France on Wednesday said it would stiffen a quarantine requirement, amplifying the risk of further setbacks.  “It's clearly very disappointing,” Willie Walsh, the director general of the International Air Transport Association, said in a briefing in response to the French move. “We're seeing political reaction not to data but to anecdote.” U.K. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Thursday that Britain is currently examining the case for exempting vaccinated travelers from costly PCR tests when they return from their holiday. The government is awaiting feedback from scientists, most likely in time for the first review of the rules behind the traffic-light system on June 28. Some determined travelers, meanwhile, are forging ahead to amber-listed destinations despite a required 10 days of self-quarantine on return. Walsh said he sees no issues with doing that. There’s hope in the industry that people who have saved money and vacation days will give the late-starting summer some staying power into the fall shoulder season of September and October. “I’m still optimistic that we'll see a good recovery in the second half of this year,”  Walsh said. “We're heading in the right direction.” Globally, the rebound in airline capacity slipped one percentage point in the past week to 57% of 2019 levels, based on Bloomberg’s weekly flight tracker, which uses OAG data to monitor the pulse of the comeback. The U.S., which has posted steady gains over the past several weeks,  took a breather and is now back below 75% of pre-crisis capacity. Nevertheless, airlines are becoming  increasingly optimistic, with  Delta Air Lines Inc. saying its recovery is progressing faster than it expected,  United Airlines Holdings Inc. bullish on fares, and  American Airlines Group Inc. predicting a rebound in long distance business travel.  The trans-Atlantic market is cracking open a bit, with some European countries allowing vaccinated Americans to enter. But the lucrative niche, important for the big three American carriers along with British Airways,  Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Air France-KLM in Europe, won’t come back until Europeans can travel to the U.S. While optimism is increasing, “airlines need to be able to sell from both ends of the route and not purely rely on the North American demand,” said John Grant, chief analyst at OAG. There’s a chance that the U.S. makes the U.K. green list when it’s updated, but there’s little sign President Joe Biden is ready to lighten entry restrictions for foreign travelers.  Declines in Asia, Africa and the Middle East weighed on the totals, as countries clamped down to prevent the spread of new variants. Countries continue to limit ties to India, where the health system remains under  enormous strain. In Japan, a rise in coronavirus cases led the U.S. to issue a “do not travel” advisory,  sowing doubt over whether the Olympic Games can be held as scheduled in July. In Europe, the flight schedules are deteriorating slightly. In the past week, airlines in the region have  trimmed back their schedules for the coming month by about 4%, according to data from Bloomberg NEF. Tour operator TUI AG  canceled holidays to a number of amber- and red-listed countries, including Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, Mexico and Bulgaria through June 27.  Travel to Eastern Europe is set to get more difficult after European and U.K. aviation authorities told airlines to avoid the airspace of Belarus. The moves came in response to the regime’s diversion of a  Ryanair Holdings Plc passenger flight to its capital, Minsk, where authorities arrested a dissident Belarusian journalist aboard. Governments from Europe to the U.S. have largely condemned the action and dismissed the purported bomb threat that triggered the incident as a ruse. Until now, Belarus was one of the shining lights of a travel comeback in central and eastern Europe. "

That’s the most since March 7, 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic was in its early stages. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eased its guidance on wearing masks in public this month, saying fully vaccinated people could generally do without face coverings. Masks while flying or riding public transit remain a CDC recommendation. While airline passenger numbers have yet to reach pre-pandemic levels, they are much improved this year.

Europe’s biggest discount airline expects to attract up to 9 million passengers in July and August compared with 5 million in June and just 1.7 million in May, O’Leary told Bloomberg Television in an interview Thursday. “We’re seeing a very strong recovery in bookings, German leisure, Benelux leisure, Scandinavian leisure, heading to the beaches of Portugal, Spain, Greece and Italy,” O’Leary said. “We expect that to continue into July and August, which should make for a reasonable recovery.” Demand has been spurred as the EU rolls out its Digital Covid Certificate from July 1, allowing travelers to move between member states provided they are fully vaccinated, have recovered from the virus or can show a negative test result. The reopening marks a step toward securing vital summer revenue after a series of false starts amid the spread of new viral variants. Still, only about 50% of available seats have been booked for July and 30% for August, compared with up to 70% normally, putting the focus on luring back passengers to maximize sales and leading fares to be cut, O’Leary said. The CEO said that the U.K. and Ireland are lagging behind the recovery in mainland Europe. Britain has been overly cautious in limiting movement in response to the Delta variant of the virus, he said, while predicting that more countries will be added to its quarantine-free “green list” from July 19. Allowing unfettered travel for vaccinated passengers, something currently under discussion in the U.K., would spur “a very strong recovery” in demand and Ryanair would restore capacity to the country that’s been deployed elsewhere, he said, while cautioning that the EU could impose limits of its own. Malta, on the U.K. green list, last week imposed a quarantine for non-vaccinated Britons, with Portugal following suit, though it had already been moved to the amber category requiring people to self-isolate on their return to the U.K. Spain’s green-listed Balearic Islands will let British tourists in if they test negative for Covid-19 on arrival. O’Leary said the situation could be eased if the U.K. health service’s own coronavirus pass was to be made interoperable with the EU vaccine certificate. That’s something several EU states pushed the European Commission to address at a meeting of ambassadors on Wednesday, according to a diplomatic memo seen by Bloomberg."

Operating profit for the year through March 2022 will be 28 billion yen ($257 million), Japan’s No. 1 carrier said in a statement Friday, seeking to deliver on last year’s pledge to return to profit despite the spread of Covid-19. That compares with analysts’ average projection for a 93.6 billion yen loss, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ANA’s operating loss for the year through March was 465 billion yen, in line with a narrower forecast issued last week. Revenue fell 63% to 729 billion yen. “It’ll be hard for ANA to achieve the forecast without cutting a lot of costs,” said Yasuo Hashimoto, principal consultant at Japan Aviation Management Research. “The second quarter, including summer holidays, will be an important source of income as it’s a high season.” The airline has been lowering costs by retiring large aircraft including Boeing Co. 777s, and dispatching employees to other companies instead of shedding jobs. It has also reduced office space as more staff work from home. More: Full Planes to Disney World Are Only Step One: Brooke Sutherland ANA and Japan Airlines Co. may find themselves lagging their peers, especially in the U.S., where Southwest Airlines Co. reported an operating profit of $199 million for the first three months of the year. United Airlines Holdings Inc. said earlier this month that it would start hiring pilots again. Complicating the Japanese carriers’ recovery prospects, the country declared a third state of emergency last week to combat rising infections in major cities including Osaka and Tokyo. Japan’s vaccination rollout has been relatively slow compared with the U.S., U.K. and some other countries in Asia. ANA and Japan Airlines aren’t likely to get much of a boost from the Tokyo Olympics in July either, which will be held without overseas spectators. Even so, domestic demand is seen rising from later this summer, according to Hashimoto. The airline industry’s domestic markets could potentially recover to 96% of pre-Covid levels in the second half of 2021, according to IATA. ANA shares rose 1.1% before the results. ANA is up about 10% this year, following a 37% slump in 2020. While cost cuts are going faster than anticipated, “I don’t think the worst is over yet,” CEO Katanozaka said at an earnings briefing. The aviation industry has been pummeled as countries closed their borders and international travel dried up, and the recovery will likely be slow. Airlines are expected to lose a combined $48 billion in 2021, the International Air Transport Association has said. Still, ANA Chief Executive Officer Shinya Katanozaka said the company will turn cash-flow positive around July, with current spending sustainable for another three years."

Santiago-based Latam, which has now been in U.S. bankruptcy for more than a year, has its sights set on a strong Chapter 11 exit -- not a piecemeal sale of the business, Alvo said in an interview Wednesday. The carrier’s shares briefly slumped last week after it denied reports that Azul SA planned to buy Latam’s Brazilian subsidiary. While Alvo said he is “absolutely not” selling the Sao Paulo-based unit to the low cost competitor, Azul is now waiting to evaluate Latam’s bankruptcy exit plan and may propose the acquisition offer directly to Latam creditors, according to a person familiar with the matter. Azul has unsuccessfully floated to Latam executives the idea of carving out the domestic Brazil network, according to the person. Under the proposal, Latam, the largest airline in Latin America, would have been left to focus on business elsewhere in the region while maintaining links to the route network in Brazil, the person said. “We are not considering in any way, shape or form, any sale of any of our assets at this point in time,” Alvo said Wednesday. “We take this more as a sign of concern of Azul, as they understand we will be a very challenging competitor” after exiting bankruptcy, he said. A representative for Azul declined to comment. Latam sought court protection from creditors in New York last year as the Covid-19 lockdown brought global travel to a halt. Since then, it has obtained $2.45 billion of fresh financing, worked to restructure its fleet of planes and recently ended a codeshare agreement with Azul. Azul, one of Brazil’s largest airlines, said in a statement following the codeshare termination that it had hired advisers and was “actively exploring industry consolidation opportunities in the region.” Keeping Brazil in its network is a key part of Latam’s strategy going forward, Alvo said. The country has “huge” growth potential and Latam “will be a very aggressive, very effective competitor” once travel demand recovers, he said. But first, Latam needs to find its way out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy, an often labyrinthine process that usually ends with shareholders getting wiped out and new ownership stepping in. Capital markets have smiled upon Latam’s prospects in recent months, with bonds tied to the company now trading at about 95 cents on the dollar from as low as 16 cents last year. Latam hopes to receive proposals from “backstop financiers” in the coming weeks as it crafts its bankruptcy exit plan, Alvo said. The carrier is aiming to exit Chapter 11 toward the end of the year."

Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. will cut 6,000 jobs and close its Cathay Dragon brand, the South China Morning Post reported, as part of a strategic review to combat the deep damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Hong Kong-based airline is expected to officially announce the plan after the market close on Wednesday, the newspaper said. It initially planned about 8,000 layoffs globally, but after government intervention reduced that to 18% of its total workforce, including some 5,000 jobs in Hong Kong, according to the report. The company, which posted a HK$9.9 billion ($1.3 billion) loss in the first half, has for months been working on the review that management presented to the board on Monday. Cathay said in September it wouldn’t survive unless it adapted its airlines for the “new travel market.” A Cathay representative didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. Cathay’s passenger traffic slumped as travel restrictions escalated and people refrained from flying, with numbers as low as 500 a day in April and May. On Oct. 19, the company said it expected to operate at about 10% of pre-pandemic capacity for the rest of the year and well below a quarter in the first half of 2021. For September, passenger numbers were down 98.1% from a year earlier. Cathay carried out a HK$39 billion recapitalization plan that was completed in August and left the Hong Kong government with a 6.08% stake in the company and two observer seats on its board. In another effort to cushion the blow from the loss of passengers, the airline has been renegotiating aircraft deliveries from Airbus SE and Boeing Co. Cathay already introduced an unpaid leave program for staff earlier in the year as monthly losses climbed to as much as HK$3 billion, and trimmed salaries and closed crew bases overseas. Chairman Patrick Healy said in August that those cost control measures wouldn’t be enough. The company was struggling with losses before the pandemic as anti-government protests in Hong Kong led to a sharp reduction in traffic last year and a change in management. Then Covid-19 erupted, thrusting the airline into what Healy described as the most challenging period in its history. Cathay Dragon flies Airbus SE A320, A321 and A330 aircraft to destinations across Asia and more than 20 mainland Chinese cities, including the lucrative Beijing and Shanghai routes. The carrier had a fleet of 48 aircraft as of June 30 and firm orders for 16 Airbus A321neo jets, according to Cathay’s website. Combined, Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon employ about 21,000 people in Hong Kong. The group as a whole, which includes budget carrier HK Express -- bought by Cathay last year -- and cargo operator AHK Air Hong Kong, has more than 33,000 employees worldwide. The latest development comes as Hong Kong said its jobless rate rose to a 15-year high of 6.4% in the July-September period as the economy remained stuck in recession. That reading was worse than the 6.2% median estimate from economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Travel, hotels, retail and restaurants have been particularly hurt as the government keeps strict social-distancing measures in place, including limiting public gatherings to four people. Cathay Pacific is one of the city’s biggest employers. Job losses in the airline industry are mounting worldwide. Singapore Airlines Ltd., which like Cathay has no domestic market and raised billions of dollars to try to weather the crisis, said in September it was eliminating about 4,300 jobs, roughly 20% of its workforce. Airlines have flagged that as many as 400,000 people will either be let go or furloughed since January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Cathay and Singapore Airlines got a boost on Oct. 15 with the announcement of plans for a travel bubble between Hong Kong and Singapore that will replace compulsory quarantine with coronavirus testing. Cathay’s shares jumped on the news and airfares climbed for the route, which likely accounted for about 3% of its overall revenue before the pandemic, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Cathay’s shares, down 43% in Hong Kong this year, slipped 1.4% on Tuesday."

No reason was immediately provided on why the announcement -- which Bloomberg had reported was expected as soon as Thursday -- was postponed and a new date hasn’t been set, said the people, who asked not to be identified as they’re not authorized to speak publicly. The cancellation was initiated by the Singapore side, one of the people said. Singapore and Hong Kong have been trying to revive their bubble plans after a previously scheduled November start was shelved due to a virus flareup in Hong Kong. A new start date was planned for May, people familiar have said, though that’s now uncertain. While it’s unclear what triggered Thursday’s postponement, it comes as Singapore faces new virus cases among its migrant worker community, which underpinned the city’s major outbreak last year. Covid hasn’t hit the two Asian hubs as hard as many other places, at least in terms of numbers: Hong Kong has recorded 11,704 confirmed cases since the pandemic began, while Singapore has reported 30 deaths. But the compact nature of the cities means that outbreaks regarded as minor elsewhere have been enough to derail plans to open borders. Mutant virus strains and hesitancy among the public to get vaccinated have also added extra layers of caution. Hong Kong has been trying to resume cross-border travel in a gradual and orderly manner with places where the epidemic is stable and economic and trade ties are strong, a government spokesperson said Thursday. Discussions between Hong Kong and Singapore are ongoing and an announcement will be made “in due course,” the spokesperson said. Singapore’s Ministry of Transport said that “Singapore and Hong Kong have been in close consultations on the air travel bubble. We have not fixed a date to announce the resumption of the bubble, but will do so once we are ready, hopefully very soon.” Travel corridors have faced teething problems elsewhere, too. A bubble between New Zealand and Australia opened Monday after months in the making. The following day, a worker at Auckland International Airport tested positive for the virus, despite being fully vaccinated. The travel bubble hasn’t been affected, however. Singapore Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said earlier this month that he hopes an agreement on the air-travel bubble would be announced “soon,” echoing Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s earlier comments. Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and Singapore Airlines Ltd. would operate the flights between the two cities. While the limited number of bubble trips would do little to plug their pandemic-related losses, any opening would be a positive step for the carriers as well as people who haven’t left either city for a year or more, dissuaded in part by strict quarantine requirements. In an announcement Wednesday, Singapore eased quarantine rules for those traveling to Hong Kong. Travelers from Hong Kong will have to stay in home isolation for seven days upon arriving in Singapore, down from a previous rule of 14 days in a government-selected hotel. There are now concerns that a reappearance of the virus in Singapore could upend the easing plans. The city, which saw a massive outbreak among its army of low-wage migrant workers last year, said Thursday that 11 workers at Westlite Woodlands dormitory had tested positive for Covid-19. Among them, 10 had previously been infected and recovered, according to a government statement. The flareup raises fears that the virus is again circulating among the workers, who live in close conditions in accommodation segregated from the wider community. Their movements are highly restricted by the government, though the rest of the population has seen social and economic activity normalize after Singapore contained its outbreak last year."

The statement from Rosaviatsiya was the first Russian official explanation for permit holdups that had led Air France and Austrian Airlines to cancel flights in recent days. It comes a day after the Austrian Foreign Ministry called the disruption “totally incomprehensible.” Austrian Airlines said Friday it had received permission to conduct a rerouted passenger flight between Vienna and Moscow, avoiding Belarusian airspace, but was still waiting for approval on a cargo trip between Vienna and Nanjing, which it said it expected. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the sudden surge in rerouting requests was “extraordinary,” adding that “technical hangups were inevitable.” Authorities “are working intensively to liquidate them,” he said. The European Union’s air-safety regulator advised airlines to avoid flying over Belarus following the diversion of a Ryanair Holdings Plc flight on Sunday, which raised doubts about Minsk’s respect for international aviation rules. Skirting Belarus causes minor changes in airlines’ anticipated flight path once they enter Russia, for which they need permission from local aviation authorities. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova denounced the EU move to avoid Belarusian airspace as “politically motivated,” calling it “complete irresponsibility that put the safety of passengers at risk.” Rosaviatsiya said it had informed foreign airlines Thursday that rerouting permissions might take longer to process. The agency said in a statement Friday that 53 flights had been rerouted around Belarus in the last 24 hours, while 113 European flights continued over that country, in addition to 134 Russian ones."

The forced landing and arrest of Raman Pratasevich, 26, who had fled Belarus after covering nationwide protests last year, drew sharp and unified condemnation from the U.S. and the European Union. EU leaders, meeting for dinner in Brussels Monday at the start of a two-day summit, will weigh measures such as travel restrictions and possible flight bans, according to two officials familiar with the matter. That would be top of a new sanctions package that Brussels was preparing to present next month. WATCH: Belarus ordered a Ryanair flight transiting its airspace to land and arrested a journalist on board. (Source: Bloomberg) Raman Pratasevich is detained by police in Minsk, Belarus in March 2017. But the bloc’s influence may be limited after years of sanctions against Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko’s regime have had little impact and Minsk enjoys strong support from its closest ally in Moscow after a brutal crackdown on opponents. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen promised leaders would discuss consequences for Belarus’s diversion of the plane as it flew between Athens and Vilnius, calling it a “hijacking” and urging Pratasevich’s immediate release. The simplest route for the EU is to impose more sanctions against individuals and entities, according to one of the officials. Other options, such as suspension of all flights by EU airlines over Belarus, banning state carrier Belavia from landing at airports in the bloc, and a halt to all transit, including ground travel from Belarus to the EU, would trigger increased costs for European companies, the person said. Restrictions on air travel, meanwhile, risk further isolating ordinary Belarusian citizens after land borders were effectively closed for most travel to EU countries and Ukraine under the pretext of coronavirus restrictions. Belarus’s Soviet-style economy depends mostly on trade with Moscow, which provides vital energy supplies and buys billions in Belarusian products. The EU accounts for about 20% of Belarus’s trade turnover compared to about half with Russia, according to the country’s foreign ministry. Worries over potential sanctions are scaring away bond investors. Belarus’s dollar bonds due 2031 tanked on Monday, sending yields surging 60 basis points to 7.84%, the highest since August. The international fury was triggered after a Mig-29 fighter jet escorted the Boeing Co. 737-800 carrying scores of passengers to the Belarusian capital Sunday, following a bomb threat that turned out to be fake. “This was a case of state-sponsored hijacking,” Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary said in comments broadcast by RTE Radio. The airline has to do a “detailed debrief today with the NATO and EU authorities” after the incident, which he said saw passengers and crew held under armed guard. Pratasevich, the former editor-in-chief of one the most popular Telegram news channels in Belarus, wasn’t on the plane when it was allowed to take off again for Vilnius, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said in a recorded statement. The news channel, Nexta Live, extensively covered the protests against Lukashenko’s disputed sixth election victory in August and the government’s deadly response. ​Pratasevich’s girlfriend, a Russian citizen, was also detained in Minsk, according to the European Humanities University in Vilnius, where she’s a student. At least four other people also remained in the Belarusian capital, according to Lithuanian officials.  “We believe there was also some KGB agents offloaded off the aircraft as well,” O’Leary said. Read More: How Belarus Snatched a Dissident Off a Ryanair Plane From Greece A spokeswoman for the Interior Ministry in Minsk declined to comment. “This is a serious and dangerous incident, which requires international investigation,” NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said on Twitter. The post-election crackdown by Lukashenko’s administration on the opposition already resulted in U.S. and EU sanctions, and ended a brief detente with the West. “This is clearly a sign of confidence from Lukashenko,” Ryhor Astapenia, director of the Belarus Initiative at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, said. “It shows he is pretty sure now that he controls everything in the country, that he has managed to suppress the protests and is sure he can survive any foreign pressure that can come from the EU, the U.S. or the West in general.” Lukashenko, in office since 1994, is slated to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Russian state television reported Sunday. The Foreign Ministry in Moscow defended Belarus’s move. “It’s shocking that the West is calling an incident in Belarus’s airspace ‘shocking,’” spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Facebook. The latest incident has the potential to influence already strained ties between President Joe Biden and Putin, even as the two leaders move toward a potential first summit as soon as next month. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned the move, saying the Biden administration supports the earliest possible meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organization to review Sunday’s events. The situation won’t effect plans for the summit, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call with reporters Monday, while declining to comment on the details of the case. Pratasevich and his Nexta colleague Stsiapan Putsila were accused of organizing mass unrest and group actions severely violating public order, the Investigative Committee said on Nov. 5. They were also accused of stirring “social hatred” against law enforcers via their Telegram channels. Franak Viacorka, an adviser to the Belusian opposition, said that the arrest may also allow the authorities in Belarus to obtain information about fellow opposition members, facilitating a broader repression of independent reporting. U.S. lawmakers joined with counterparts from seven other countries in calling for an inquiry by the Montreal-based ICAO into the incident. “Until ICAO has reported, we call for Belarus to be suspended from the organization and a ban on all overflight of Belarus including flights to and from the country,” Senator Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement."

The Montreal-based airline said it’s cutting the offer for Transat to C$5 a share from C$18 when the deal was announced in August 2019, valuing the company at about C$190 million ($145 million). Transat’s investors can choose between receiving a cash payment or 0.2862 Air Canada shares for each stock they hold, according to the statement Saturday. The previous offer was an all-cash deal. “Covid-19 has had a devastating effect on the global airline industry, with a material impact on the value of airlines and aviation assets,” Air Canada Chief Executive Officer Calin Rovinescu said in the statement. “This combination will provide stability for Transat’s operations and its stakeholders and will position Air Canada, and indeed the Canadian aviation industry, to emerge more strongly as we enter the post-Covid-19 world.” Shares of Transat, which also owns an air carrier, slumped 76% this year, among the 10 worst performers on the S&P/Toronto Stock Exchange Smallcap Index as the pandemic hit travel-related stocks. Air Canada lost 67%. The steep reduction in the offer price is a turnaround in events where Air Canada previously sweetened its offer to C$18 from C$13. Still, the revised proposal is 31% higher than Transat’s closing price of C$3.83 on Friday. The transaction is now expected to be completed in late-January or early February next year. Transat also announced a new C$250 million short-term loan facility."

But their friends are fretting over the costs. At first, Shanel Carter was looking forward to the wedding season. The pandemic was winding down, her best friends were getting hitched and she was ready to celebrate. Then, the invitations kept coming. Enjoying Bloomberg Wealth? To read more articles based on your personal financial goals, answer these 3 questions that will tailor your reading experience. “My excitement morphed into dread and anxiety,” said Carter, 34, who has already been to two weddings in 2021 and plans to go to four more in the next year, plus three bachelorette parties and two bridal showers. She recently backed out of a seventh wedding. “I had to turn down a bridal shower, I had to turn down a bachelorette, because I’m in the process of buying a home, and so money was the first thing that crossed my mind.” She’s budgeting for weddings in Barbados, Charleston, Chicago and New Orleans, and bachelorettes in the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos, and estimates it’ll all cost about $9,000. And that’s before extra meals, outfits, out-of-pocket expenses while traveling and the time off from work that she has to request. As the pandemic abates, couples who got engaged during Covid-19 lockdowns are planning to tie the knot, and weddings that were postponed in 2020 are moving forward. Marriages in the U.S. are set to rebound by more than 50% this year after slumping about 40% in 2020, according to data from The Wedding Report, an industry research firm. The rising trend is expected to persist into next year, when almost 2.5 million weddings are expected — the most since 1984. To be sure, large swathes of the population are still reeling from the economic devastation sparked by the pandemic and related lockdowns, leaving many couples without the means to have a wedding celebration, even if they wanted to. And even as  Covid vaccines are being administered, and economic activity has picked up and white-collar workers return to their offices, millions of Americans still remain unemployed — reflecting a myriad of factors including child care challenges and lingering coronavirus concerns. But for those couples who can afford it, the excitement of finally being able to get hitched is providing the impetus for grand plans. That means potentially more expenses for their guests — who might have to spend thousands of dollars on travel, lodging, gifts to attend a slew of events: bachelorette and bachelor weekends, bridal showers and engagement parties. A third of bridal party members took on debt for a friend’s wedding, according to a survey by online lending marketplace LendingTree. Those that went into debt included 43% of maids of honor, 38% of best men, 35% of bridesmaids and 30% of groomsmen, the survey found. Bachelor and bachelorette parties, wedding attire, travel to and from the marriage were some of the biggest expenses. The number of wedding websites published on The Knot in June 2021 was 48% more than the same month in 2019. Gift purchases on The Knot Registry, meanwhile, more than doubled in the second quarter of this year compared to the first three months of 2021. Couples are also inviting more people — there were seven times as many invitation purchases in June, compared with March. “Many of the weddings from last year that rescheduled moved to this year, and if you layer on top of that those that typically get married in a year, that’s what you really see as the surge,” said Shane McMurray, founder of The Wedding Report. “I think next year will be more of a surge than this year.” Historically, it wasn’t the wedding couple that would dictate where the bridal shower, bachelor and bachelorette parties were held, according to Jodi Smith, an etiquette consultant. Instead, attendees would get together, set a budget and plan the event. But things have now changed. Guests need to review their budget and speak honestly, Smith said. “What’s changed is the scale and scope,” Smith said. “Couples need to take that into consideration that there’s a chance their friends or relatives will say no to being at their wedding because they simply can’t afford to attend and spending money on somebody is not equivalent with friendship. I shouldn’t have to prove that I’m friends with you by going into debt.” Even in the wealthiest enclaves, some venues are trying to lure in brides and their guests with deals. On any given weekend night at Calissa, a Greek restaurant in the Hamptons, brides-to-be celebrate their final bit of time before entering matrimony. The venue has seen so much demand from bachelorette parties that earlier this summer it began limiting reservations to 50 people for such events. Brooke Baldinger, 30, went to Calissa to celebrate a friend’s bachelorette in early June. At $650 for the weekend, she said it was cheaper than what she’s spent before when some of her best friends were getting married. In the next year, Baldinger has eight marriages to attend, three of which require pre-wedding events: engagement parties, bachelorettes and bridal showers. During the summer, when prices tend to be higher, she has to go to three weddings — in Connecticut, upstate New York and Vermont. She’s predicting a $5,000 budget for hotels, car reservations and trains. The pre-wedding parties alone can cost guests as much or more than attending the actual weddings. Shravan Malaney, 29, has eight weddings to go to this year and two bachelor parties. On top of the travel, there’s the cost of the Airbnb and any activities and meals. Those “can add up pretty significantly,” Malaney said. He’s expecting to spend $1,000 on the bachelor parties and another $4,200 on all the weddings. “Now that I’m tallying up these numbers, I’m like ‘holy sh-t, I’m spending a lot of money on weddings,’” he said. “I don’t know how my body’s going to handle it for the next two years.”"

While there’s a long way to go from a presidential directive to final regulations, the president’s directive seeks to address the sharp increase in consolidation of industries over the last two decades, which has raised worries that the biggest companies are choking off competition and innovation. The Federal Communications Commission is asked to reinstate net neutrality rules that barred internet service providers from blocking or slowing certain content or speeding up delivery for a price. Those rules had been implemented under former President Barack Obama but rolled back under former President Donald Trump. The order also calls on the FCC to prevent internet providers from negotiating exclusive deals with landlords that leave renters with just one internet option, and to limit high termination fees cable companies charge when consumers switch providers. The Federal Trade Commission is asked to establish rules on data collection by tech companies and regulations barring “unfair methods of competition” by the biggest tech platforms in order to protect businesses that depend on the companies to reach customers. Many of the steps outlined in the order reprise Obama administration policies that were unpopular with both industry and Republicans, presaging a fight at the agencies. A major cable group Friday called Biden’s statements “misleading,” and a group representing largest phone companies AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. said “context and facts are largely missing” from the White House’s release outlining its broadband policies. The order, which blames consolidation in banking for raising costs for consumers and restricting credit to small businesses, calls on the Justice Department and banking regulators to update guidelines on bank mergers to toughen scrutiny of deals. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is asked to issue rules to make it easier for consumers to switch banks by allowing them to download their banking data and take it with them. For more: Banking Merger Frenzy May Meet Early End After Biden Order The order targets areas where it says the lack of competition increases prices and reduces access to quality care, starting with prescription drug prices. Biden’s order will call on federal health officials to work with states to come up with plans to import medicines from Canada, where they are cheaper. The president’s plan in some ways echoes policies that Trump proposed a year ago. Then, Canada balked at the proposal to let Americans import medicines, and the neighbor to the north later imposed measures limiting distribution of drugs to protect its supply from bulk sales across the border. Biden has directed the Department of Health and Human Services to issue a comprehensive plan within 45 days to counter high drug prices. That could bring back proposals by Trump and some Democrats to benchmark drugs to the cheaper prices paid in countries with national health systems. It’s a move that drugmakers said would stifle innovation. Biden will also urge the FTC to stop pharmaceutical manufacturers from paying their generic counterparts to delay entry into the market of lower-priced versions of medications. That idea is part of pending legislation in the Senate and aligns with campaign promises Biden made last year. The Association for Accessible Medicine, the leading trade group for the generic drug industry, said it’s looking forward to working with the Biden administration to increase adoption of lower-cost generics and biosimilars “and remedy the growing number of government and payer policies that perversely reward the use of high-cost brands over generic or biosimilar competitors.” Hospital consolidation has increased health-care costs and reduced service for some communities, especially rural areas, the order notes. The executive order directs the Justice Department and FTC to tighten their merger guidelines for hospital deals. It also directs HHS to support hospital price transparency rules and finish implementing legislation to address surprise hospital billing. Health-care interests that could face tighter antitrust scrutiny pushed back on the order and asserted that it could block patients’ from needed care. “Miring hospitals in legal and bureaucratic red tape will simply slow critical care to the bedside,” said Chip Kahn, Chief Executive Officer of the for-profit hospital trade group Federation of American Hospitals. The Biotechnology Innovation Organization said it’s evaluating the order, but urged Biden to focus on lowering out-of-pocket costs influenced by other companies in the supply chain. “That price is set by PBMs, insurers and the government, NOT by biopharmaceutical companies,” BIO policy chief John Murphy said. Steve Ubl, CEO of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said the U.S. already had “the world’s most competitive market for prescription medicines” in a statement that cited falling net prices and high rates of generic drug uptake.  The order calls for new rules to benefit farmers and ranchers. It directs the Agriculture Department to make it easier for cow, pig and poultry farms to sue large processors if they are underpaid or retaliated against. It also asks the USDA to consider issuing new rules defining when meat can bear “Product of USA” labels to restrict companies from labeling food produced overseas as American-made when it was simply processed domestically.The measure also orders the Agriculture Department to help farmers access markets and receive a fair return on their goods, including supporting alternative food distribution systems like farmers’ markets and developing standards and labels so that consumers can choose to buy products that treat farmers fairly.It encourages the FTC to keep equipment manufacturers from limiting consumers’ ability to repair products at independent shops or on their own. The move is intended to especially benefit farmers, who face expensive repair costs from tractor manufacturers that use proprietary tools and software to prevent third parties from working on equipment. Farmer advocates say the rules are much-needed to combat heavy consolidation in crops, seeds, chemicals and meat, in which a small group of multinational companies are capturing an increasingly large share of profits at the expense of family farms. The labor market element of the order focuses on restricting the non-compete agreements that have become common in certain industries and limit worker mobility. The measure also asks for updated antitrust rules regarding companies that share wage and benefit information to avoid competing for workers. It asks the FTC to eliminate occupational licensing requirements that can create barriers of entry for new job applicants in certain fields. Biden also reiterated his support for a pro-labor bill that passed the House and is stalled in the Senate, which would make it easier for workers to organize in unions. Biden is also taking aim at consolidation in the airline industry, especially the extra fees for things like baggage, on-flight services and cancellations, which are “often raised in lockstep, demonstrating a lack of meaningful competitive pressure,” according to the White House. The EO says the top 10 airlines collected $35.2 billion in assorted fees in 2018, compared to only $1.2 billion in 2007. The order instructs the Transportation Department to make sure those fees are transparent and, when the service isn’t provided, refunded. The order also directs DOT to examine other potentially controversial issues, including  consumer protections for airline passengers and how carriers are awarded slots at congested hubs. DOT and the Justice Department must also consult on how to “ensure competition in air transportation and the ability of new entrants to gain access,” which could prompt reviews of recent agreements between carriers. For railroads, currently dominated by just a handful of freight rail companies, the measure would require track owners to give right of way for passenger rail and to treat other freight companies equally. The measure also addresses shipping fees, which domestic manufacturers are currently forced to pay to foreign companies. Freight railroad and shipping trade groups expressed opposition to Biden’s order, saying that there’s sufficient competition among their industries and the order would put them at a disadvantage. “We urge everyone to make decisions based on the real facts about the situation before we create long-term negative results through ill-considered regulatory changes to handle a temporary situation,” John Butler, president and CEO of the trade group World Shipping Council, said in a statement. Competition within the U.S. airline industry has produced historically low inflation-adjusted air fares and expanded opportunities for travel, including from two new carriers that started operations this year, Airlines for America said in a statement Friday. The Biden order echoes an Obama administration order in 2016 that said government agencies beyond those responsible for antitrust enforcement had a role to play in protecting consumers, workers and business from being harmed by instances of market power in the economy. Unlike the Biden order, however, Obama’s didn’t direct individual agencies to take specific actions and instead required them to come up with their own plans. That order built off a report by the Council of Economic Advisers outlining evidence that industries across the U.S. economy suffer from rising consolidation and declining competition. Since then, attention to the power of dominant companies has only grown as economists and policy makers raise concern that rising concentration is ailing large swaths of the economy and contributing to problems including income inequality, stagnant wages and low productivity growth. While the drafting and implementation of new rules and regulations may take months and will be largely handled by individual departments and agencies, the White House has made clear it expects that the executive order could lead to significant changes that entail a major impact on several industries. The measure advances the administration’s push to step up antitrust enforcement amid widespread criticism that enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission haven’t gone far enough to police mergers and anticompetitive conduct. Last month, Biden unexpectedly named Columbia Law School professor Lina Khan to lead the FTC, putting one of the most prominent advocates for a far more forceful antitrust agenda in charge of the agency.Biden has yet to nominate a chief for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, leaving the unit without political leadership five months into the administration as it forges ahead with a monopoly case against Alphabet Inc.’s Google and a lawsuit to block Aon Plc’s proposed $30 billion acquisition of Willis Towers Watson Plc. The White House effort adds to a widespread push for stronger antitrust enforcement in Washington, where bipartisan majorities on the House Judiciary Committee in June advanced six antitrust bills, primarily aimed at the biggest tech companies. The proposals represent an effort to revamp antitrust laws and give competition enforcers more authority. Business groups in Washington quickly criticized the order. “Today’s executive order is built on the flawed belief that our economy is over-concentrated, stagnant and fails to generate private investment needed to spur innovation,” said Neil Bradley, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “Such broadsided claims are out of touch with reality, as our economy has proven to be resilient and remains the envy of the world.” The National Association of Manufacturers added, “some of the actions announced today are solutions in search of a problem; they threaten to undo our progress by undermining free markets and are premised on the false notion that our workers are not positioned for success.” The White House blames declining competition across the economy for raising prices of necessities like prescription drugs, lowering wages for workers and acting as a drag on growth and innovation. Here are details on some of the initiatives outlined in the order and reaction from industry groups:"

At best, the path ahead will be bumpy, with progress toward a  return to travel dependent on the pace of vaccine roll-outs, access to capital, government policies and the unpredictability of a virus that’s not yet fully understood. Still, there will be leaps, including the first commercial flights to near-space. Here are some developments to look for over the next 12 months. Airline traffic won’t see a major boost until vaccines saturate populations enough to stamp down infection rates. Even then, it may take effort to get some people back on planes. In Europe, that’ll mean fares as low as 9.99 euros ($12.33), according to Ryanair Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Michael O’Leary. The Irish discounter on Thursday  slashed its schedule through March, underscoring the uncertainties  still clouding the industry outlook. Other ideas being floated to entice travelers are free hotel stays, 2-for-1 deals and complimentary travel insurance. Travel-pass promotions from carriers such as China Eastern Airlines Corp., which is offering unlimited flights for a single price, have proved popular, while online agents show ultra-cheap trips in China for the Lunar New Year holiday next month. The key question is how long it’ll take to wean customers off those incentives. An upturn in leisure and family travel should hit most regions by around midyear. More lucrative business traffic is likely to trail as companies resist sending people out on the road. John Grant, chief analyst at flight-bookings specialist OAG, says it won’t be a recovery until enticements are no longer needed and carriers can manage routes for profit. Airlines raised record amounts of money in 2020. More will be required in 2021. Stock sales and debt conversions will take on a greater importance as companies try to restore balance sheets to health. Governments, which ponied up $220 billion in state aid last year according to Moody’s, will continue to play a role. France and the Netherlands, the largest shareholders in Air France-KLM, are in negotiations to  inject billions of euros more, while converting part of the 10.4 billion euros already loaned into hybrid debt. Carriers like EasyJet Plc are likely to raise more equity, while cash burn remains a concern, according to Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. Some airlines are in more desperate straits. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA’s court-supervised restructuring plan relies on attracting new investment and would largely drop its well-known trans-Atlantic business to focus on regional services. Creditors of bankrupt Thai Airways International Pcl are due to consider a rehabilitation plan in February. AirAsia X Bhd., the Malaysian long-distance carrier, and Thailand’s Nok Airlines Pcl are also due to present plans in coming months. U.S. airlines will receive $15 billion in federal aid to help pay workers through March 31, on top of $25 billion in similar help provided during 2020. The U.S. Treasury Department has made billions more available in the form of loans. Dozens of airlines have disappeared or filed for bankruptcy since the pandemic began. More are on life support, in danger of getting swallowed by stronger players. In Germany, Deutsche Lufthansa AG is taking straight aim at holiday specialist Condor by adding routes to sunny spots like Zanzibar and Corfu. Condor, once a Lufthansa unit that in 2019 survived the failure of then-parent Thomas Cook, could make a tempting target. However, natural consolidators like Lufthansa that accepted bailouts may be prevented from making purchases under terms of state aid packages. In India, Tata Sons Ltd. bought out struggling partner AirAsia Group Bhd.’s stake in a local  joint venture. State-owned Air India is another potential target, possibly through Vistara, Tata’s venture with Singapore Airlines Ltd. Air India’s buyer would “definitely need to make it a lot leaner,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Teo says. After years of work and premature predictions, the first “ordinary” space adventurers are poised to take flight in 2021 with billionaire Richard Branson inaugurating commercial suborbital rides at Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. The company has told investors its spacecraft will carry Branson from New Mexico in the first quarter and then commence services with a group of about 600 early customers who have paid as much as $250,000 a ticket. Branson’s venture could see competition from Jeff Bezos, who’s developing Blue Origin LLC’s New Shepard reusable rocket for suborbital rides. In October, the company performed its seventh test flight from Van Horn, Texas. It plans “a couple” more before humans fly. A third outfit, Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., is set to fly a four-person private crew for Axiom Space Inc. late in the year. The group will have a 10-day stint aboard the International Space Station as part of NASA’s efforts to spur commercial enterprise in low-earth orbit. While interest is starting to pick up for smaller jetliners, the market for twin-aisle aircraft from Airbus SE and Boeing Co. is “beyond grim,” said aerospace consultant Richard Aboulafia. Sales were depressed before the outbreak, and a surplus of used models will crimp demand for years. With long-distance travel on hold, Airbus and Boeing have seen higher retirement rates for their biggest planes within airline fleets and a dearth of new orders. And there’s not much sign of encouragement. Boeing is fighting to hold on to orders for the largest plane on the market, its 777-9, which is two years behind schedule. Analysts see more production-rate cuts ahead for the better-selling Boeing 787 -- which is also beset by production snafus -- and the Airbus A350. Output of the less-popular A330 could go down to one a month, according to Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa. The plane has struggled to attact orders despite a reengined version, with biggest customer AirAsia X’s financial troubles the latest blow. Still, analysts predict the program will limp on at lower rates rather than being scrapped. Major airlines packed into ever smaller destinations as the boom in air travel hit its zenith in 2019. Now, they’re dropping newly unprofitable routes to stem losses. Fewer flights, smaller planes and reduced big-city connections are eating into the economies of some tourism-dependent locations. A portion of the pullback could last indefinitely, according to OAG’s Grant. Particularly vulnerable are longer routes that were still in their developmental phase. From late March, British Airways will permanently axe 13 long-haul destinations across North America, the Middle East, South Africa and Asia. Cathay Pacific will cease services to seven global locations as losses mount. Cities such as Manchester, England, are vulnerable to weaker links to key markets like China, while flights from Beijing to Lisbon, Barcelona and even Madrid could come under pressure as airlines re-evaluate. Large Middle Eastern carriers like Emirates and Qatar Airways, which thrive on whisking passengers across the world, aren’t likely to fill the gaps, according to Grant. He says they’re serving as many destinations as they can, given a dearth of connecting traffic. “It’s more about getting back to pre-Covid capacity and demand levels.” While launching an airline into the teeth of the industry’s worst-ever downturn might seem reckless, there is some logic. Financing remains cheap, and the pandemic has created a huge fleet of grounded jetliners, many owned by leasing firms desperate to find new operators. Planemakers are also seeking buyers for brand-new aircraft following order cancellations -- Boeing’s 737 Max in particular as the model returns from a 20-month grounding. Incumbents have cut capacity and thousands of jobs, providing would-be rivals with a glut of experienced staff, while high debt levels limit their ability to fight back. Among projects underway, Cyrus Capital aims to revive Britain’s Flybe after buying the brand from administrators, while newly founded Emerald Airlines has won a contract to provide regional flights for Ireland’s Aer Lingus. Oslo-based Flyr, set to launch in coming months, wants to pick up traffic from Norwegian, and the founders of PT Lion Mentari Airlines are said to be planning a startup in Indonesia. In North America, Canada’s Flair Airlines aims to expand from three jets to 50 under a new brand and management, while in Miami, Global Crossing Airlines, flying as GlobalX, plans to operate charter flights to Latin America. South African lessor Global Airways helped launch discounter Lift on Dec. 10 with its own surplus jets, indicating a possible new direction for finance firms stuck with idled planes. Just as long security lines, removing your shoes and limits on liquids have colored the post 9/11 experience of air travel, Covid is likely to herald continued use of masks, social distancing and apps for passenger records. “When we look back on this in five or 10 years, it’s going to be a catalyst for many changes,” says John Strickland of airline advisory firm JLS Consulting. Customers are likely to demand airlines maintain their current high levels of hygiene, which could impact profitability. One major change that’s becoming part of the landscape is the introduction of pre-departure Covid tests. Carriers had pushed for the step as a way to encourage travel, but had little success until the detection of a new strain of the virus in Britain forced governments into a rethink. France and other European nations demanded screening for all U.K. passengers, while carriers including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. made checks mandatory for U.S.-bound flights — a policy the U.S. is itself considering for flights coming in from abroad. Separately, many airlines have eliminated change fees, and refunds could get easier after cash-strapped carriers held on to revenue for canceled flights, prompting an outcry. Improvements to processes for boarding and check-in are also likely to become permanent."

Southwest CEO Gary Kelly, dressed as Kiss’s Gene Simmons, danced at the company’s Halloween party in 2004. Kelly in past years has joined other Southwest executives in costume, including dressing as Frankenstein, Snow White, movie pirate Jack Sparrow and Gene Simmons from the rock band Kiss. This year, he’ll don masks throughout the week instead. There won’t be any of the skits, family activities, contests and parties at the airline’s Dallas headquarters, said spokesman Chris Mainz. The carrier decided months ago to cancel nonessential in-person events this year “out of an abundance of caution” because of the pandemic, he said. Southwest workers began dressing up for Halloween in the 1970s, and President Emeritus Colleen Barrett added skits and other events in the early 1980s. At American, this will be the first Halloween without a party and trick-or-treating by employees’ children since the carrier acquired US Airways in 2013. American CEO Doug Parker dressed as Billy Ray Cyrus in 2019. Source: American Airlines Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker -- whose birthday is on Halloween -- imported the annual celebration from the smaller carrier, which had inherited it from merger partner America West. In the past, he’s joined other American executives in costume, including dressing as musicians Keith Richards, Billy Ray Cyrus and Boy George. Employees at the carrier’s Fort Worth, Texas, headquarters can dress up for the day, as can airport customer-service and gate agents, said spokesman Matt Miller. The cancellation “is primarily because of the fact that we have 19,000 people on furlough -- not a very celebratory time,” he said. “Please remember to wear your masks while having fun with one another and our customers,” Kelly said in the Monday message. This is the first time Southwest has canceled its parties since 2001, following the terrorism attacks on the U.S. The coronavirus crisis has gutted air travel, forcing carriers to take billions of dollars in government loans and $25 billion in payroll support, with thousands of job cuts under way. While U.S. air travel is recovering, it is about 35% of where it was a year ago."

The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority said it has opened enforcement cases against both airlines on Wednesday. The watchdog last year opened a probe into the airline sector, following concerns that during the Covid-19 pandemic, customers were denied refunds while unable to fly and instead were offered vouchers or the option to rebook flights. The refund issue caused a backlash last year when flights were grounded and customers were forced to cancel trips that they were no longer legally allowed to take. It proved contentious from the start of the pandemic when cash-starved airlines steered passengers toward rebooking or accepting credits for future flights. U.K. Probes Airlines for Refusing Refunds During Pandemic  “While we understand that airlines have had a tough time during the pandemic, people should not be left unfairly out of pocket for following the law,” Andrea Coscelli, chief executive officer at the CMA, said in a statement. “Customers booked these flights in good faith and were legally unable to take them due to circumstances entirely outside of their control.” The airline companies will now have the opportunity to respond to the regulator’s concerns. British Airways said that it had issued well over 3 million refunds during the coronavirus crisis. “It is incredible that the government is seeking to punish further an industry that is on its knees,” the carrier said in a statement. Ryanair “approached such refund requests on a case by case basis and has paid refunds in justified cases” and that since June 2020 customers have been able to rebook flights at no extra cost, the airline said in response to the probe."
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/big-oil-attacks-the-sec-as-new-esg-rules-loom-green-insight,2021-06-30T10:00:12.981Z,Oil Lobbies Attack the SEC Over Mandatory ESG Disclosure,['Tim Quinson'],Finance,"Fossil fuel companies say the voluntary system of revealing financial risk is more than enough for shareholders. When it comes to being upfront with shareholders about the risk climate change poses to its survival, the oil industry—whose products are the key driver of global warming—is deeply divided. On one side, there are industry trade groups like Western Energy Alliance, which insist on denying the science of global warming (and certainly won’t concede its members’ role in it). On the other, there are Big Oil companies like Chevron Corp., which contend they are open to providing more information about how the climate crisis is affecting their bottom line. These contrasting positions have been made plain in comment letters sent to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulator is soliciting feedback as it considers rules mandating what companies must make public regarding the financial risk of environmental, social and governance compliance. In a world that is moving steadily away from fossil fuels, it’s safe to say the risks faced by Big Oil are great. Possibly the most aggressive memo was sent by the Western Energy Alliance, in conjunction with the U.S. Oil and Gas Association (USOGA), another industry trade group, according to researchers at Documented, which reviewed more than 580 submissions sent to the SEC. In it, these oil-funded organizations assailed the SEC and its effort to impose ESG reporting requirements, and even questioned “the extent of anthropogenic contributions” on the environment, despite the settled scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels is the main cause of accelerating, catastrophic climate change.  Their position was broadly supported by right-wing organizations including the American Enterprise Institute, the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation. What the SEC is pursuing would expand “its regulatory authority beyond investor protection and capital formation,” executives from the two oil trade groups claimed in their June 11 letter. “Implementing a comprehensive ESG disclosure framework would be yet another step into redefining the mission of the commission without congressional authority.” The National Mining Association struck a slightly more modulated tone. While the coal industry trade group doesn’t question established climate science, it mainly opposes the enactment of new rules. “The SEC shouldn’t create a one-size-fits-all, prescriptive, rules-based mandatory disclosure program given the breadth and scope of information already provided on a voluntary basis,” the NMA wrote in its 12-page letter. In March, the SEC, then led by interim Chair Allison Herren Lee, signaled that companies may soon have to start disclosing more to shareholders about how climate change affects their business. The agency, now run by Gary Gensler, is currently working on a set of regulations that would do just that. The SEC may unveil its proposals before the end of the year. The plan would then be subject to another round of public comments before a vote by commissioners to finalize the new requirements. Groups like the NMA contend that the current system of voluntary reporting “adequately informs investors of known material risks and opportunities” and nothing more is needed. Chevron, which like most fossil-fuel producers is under pressure from investors to reduce emissions, wrote in its letter to the SEC that it backs efforts by the agency “to enhance the consistency and comparability of climate information in public disclosures.” The second-largest U.S. oil company added that it “strongly encourages the commission to consider a phased approach to any new sustainability-related disclosures. This would allow the commission to focus first on those topics it deems of most importance, such as climate change disclosures,” and then it could “revisit other sustainability-related topics.” Unlike the oil trade groups, Chevron said it stands ready to offer “assistance as the commission moves forward with climate change disclosure initiatives.” By contrast, the letter from Western Energy and USOGA questions the regulator’s sincerity: Is the SEC planning to “expand its authority as to entirely upend the normal regulation and functioning of the financial system?” Sustainable Business Summit Global: On July 13-14, Bloomberg will bring together corporate leaders and investors to discuss innovation and best practices in sustainable business and finance.

The prospect of requiring tests within the U.S. was floated this month by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Rochelle Walensky, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It sparked a flurry of reaction from airlines and unions with the industry already suffering significant financial losses and job cuts due to the pandemic. U.S. airline executives met Friday with Jeff Zients, a Biden aide who serves as Covid-19 response coordinator, according to a person familiar with the matter. The White House declined to comment on the online discussion, which included the chief executive officers of United Airlines Holdings Inc., American Airlines Group Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. Testing capacity would be a potential constraint on any new domestic requirement, particularly as Biden pushes to reopen schools with a range of mitigation measures, including testing. The CDC released its schools guidance Friday afternoon. Buttigieg told Axios this week that testing passengers before domestic flights is in “active conversation with the CDC right now.” Psaki said Thursday that the administration will always consider safety measures but that “no decisions have been made around additional public health measures” for domestic flights. A negative test requirement likely would reduce domestic travel, which has recovered to only about 65% of 2019 levels, by an additional 15 to 20 percentage points, said Hunter Keay, a Wolfe Research aviation analyst. “They’re trying to dissuade bookings until the vaccine has a broader rollout,” he said. “At this point it’s not so much about the case count as it is about variants. A spike in the number of variants could have more of an influence about how the CDC thinks about this. That’s the wild card.” Discussion about testing comes as Congress considers another $15 billion in federal payroll aid that has helped avoid widespread airline employee furloughs. The government thus far has provided about $35 billion in grants and loans to 10 of the largest carriers to cover employee costs, according to figures compiled by Savanthi Syth, a Raymond James Financial Inc. analyst. In a separate program, those airlines have negotiated an additional $19.8 billion in government loans, but have drawn only $1.58 billion. The current seven-day average number of daily passengers -- about 707,000 -- is roughly half of the daily tests administered in the U.S., according to a Feb. 10 report by consulting firm Compass Lexecon. A U.S. airline commissioned the assessment, which was seen by Bloomberg News. Laboratory delays would also likely increase with a surge in new tests, the report said. Testing for travelers flying into the U.S. from other countries, adopted by the U.S. Jan. 26, is “manageable” because there are only 691 international departures each day, the Air Line Pilots Association said in a letter to the Department of Transportation. Domestically, there are more than 12,000 daily “illustrating the magnitude of the imposition of a domestic testing requirement.” A testing mandate isn’t under close consideration, though no options are being formally ruled out, the people said. No decision is imminent, they said. One expressed surprise that the issue had erupted this week. “Reports that there’s an intention to put in place new requirements, such as testing, are not accurate,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday. A Standard & Poor’s index of major U.S. carriers climbed less than 1% at 12:47 p.m. in New York, led by Delta Air Lines Inc.’s 1.8% advance to $43.49."

New York is raffling off 50 four-year full-tuition scholarships, including room and board, to any public college and university in the state to adolescents who get vaccinated. Staring Thursday through July 7, teens 12 to 17 years old who get their first vaccine dose will be in a pool to win one of ten scholarships given weekly, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced. The drawing will be held every Wednesday. Only 8.7% of New Yorkers ages 12-17 are vaccinated. Currently only the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE shot is authorized for the age group, though Moderna Inc. said this week it is seeking to have its shot authorized for teens by early June. “The greatest need is the 12-17 year olds,” Cuomo said at a news briefing Wednesday. “They are 5% of the current Covid tests but they are 10% of the positivity rate -- that’s the highest percent of any age group.” The World Health Organization has had informal consultations with member states about the next phase in efforts to find the origins of the coronavirus, and will continue to have those discussions in the coming weeks, Mike Ryan, head of the WHO health emergencies program, said in a speech to the World Health Assembly, the governing body of the Geneva-based agency. “We’re very much welcoming of your suggestions around those inputs for the next phase and around the need for further experts to be able to carry out different studies as needed,” Ryan said. “The Director-General will consider all of that over the coming weeks and we’ll be then able to communicate with you what we believe is the best next step in this journey.” The group of international scientists that traveled to Wuhan, China, where the first Covid cases emerged at the end of 2019, said in a joint report with Chinese counterparts that the pathogen most likely spread from bats to humans via another animal. A lab accident was deemed least likely, though WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus joined the U.S. and other governments in saying the probe didn’t adequately analyze the possibility of a lab leak. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration may refuse to grant new emergency use authorizations for vaccines for the remainder of the pandemic, particularly for developers that have not engaged with the agency during the past year, according to a guidance update. Vaccine makers that have already received early feedback from the agency are more likely to have the appropriate data and information needed for authorization, the agency said late Tuesday. Vaccine manufacturers stand to gain as much as $190 billion in sales this year if they hit production targets, with two Chinese companies accounting for at least a quarter of the revenue, according to Airfinity Ltd. estimates. Production constraints and shortfalls will likely bring the final 2021 sales numbers closer to a range that tops out at $115 billion, the research firm said. France will unveil extra restrictions for passengers coming from the U.K. to fend off the variant first identified in India, government spokesman Gabriel Attal said after a cabinet meeting. France will request mandatory isolation for passengers, according to Attal. Boris Johnson faced facing an onslaught of criticism over his handling of the pandemic and his suitability to be British prime minister from his former adviser Dominic Cummings. Cummings’ comments to a parliamentary hearing came as Johnson’s government was forced to backtrack over its attempt to restrict travel to coronavirus hotspots in England where the so-called Indian variant is spreading. The U-turn came after ministers were accused of introducing “local lockdowns by the back door” with the new guidance against travel to eight areas in England, which was published without fanfare online late last week but didn’t reach the attention of local leaders for several days. Germany created a 2.5 billion-euro fund to help artists and event organizers recover from the coronavirus crisis. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz called it the country’s biggest cultural fund since the end of World War II. The money would come from the 16 states and the federal government. Under the plan, the government would from July 1 pay a surcharge on tickets sold to help support events where the number of attendees is reduced by the pandemic. The plan also includes cancellation insurance for events with more than 2,000 participants. Mexico, which lost more people to Covid than almost any other country, is seeing a mammoth drop in cases and deaths, the likely result of post-infection immunity, some vaccines, warming weather and proximity to the U.S. After a deadly winter of saturated ICUs and desperate searches for oxygen tanks, Covid clinics are closing and the positivity rate of tests, which at one point was the highest in the world, is down to 17%. Hospital capacity, 90% in January, is 13%. The European Union attacked AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine supply “failure” and demanded an urgent order for millions more doses in the latest round of a bitter legal dispute over alleged broken promises by the drugmaker.

Alberta, the province that produces most of Canada’s oil, expects to lift almost all Covid-19 restrictions by July as vaccinations pick up and infections decline. Outdoor dining will be permitted in restaurants starting next week and hair salons will be allowed to book appointments, Premier Jason Kenney said in a press conference. By the middle of June, gyms will be allowed to reopen and restaurants will be able to serve people indoors. Two weeks after 70% of the population receives a first dose of vaccine, almost all restrictions will be lifted. The province expects to hit that milestone around the end of June. South Africa’s review of the Sinovac and Sputnik coronavirus vaccines is nearing completion, the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority said. China’s Sinovac Biotech Co. may be able to supply South Africa with as many as 5 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine, Johannesburg-based newspaper Business Day reported in March. In April, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize directed officials to buy 10 million doses of Russia’s Sputnik V and China’s Sinopharm shots. No applications have been received yet for the Sinopharm inoculation, officials said. New Jersey employers starting June 4 no longer must accommodate remote-working arrangements or keep on-site staff to minimum, Governor Phil Murphy announced. Employers also may allow fully vaccinated workers to choose not to mask or maintain social distance, he said at a Trenton virus update. Also, effective immediately, child-care providers no longer are subject to a limit of 15 youngsters. “This is an important piece of getting our economy back working for more parents,” the governor wrote on Twitter.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-14/airline-investors-see-a-post-pandemic-rebound-in-low-cost-travel,2021-04-14T12:00:13.574Z,Airline Investors See a Post-Pandemic Rebound in Low-Cost Travel,"['Justin Bachman', 'Mary Schlangenstein']",Business,"New money is flowing to low-cost airlines in the U.S. as they take on giant carriers racing to recover from the unprecedented collapse in travel during the pandemic.  Two established carriers that had already been flying sold shares in the past month, while two new airlines managed to raise more than $100 million each in a little over one year to cover startup costs. All four share a common trait: low operating costs and a customer base seeking affordable flights after more than a year of hunkering down close to home. They’re striking as the domestic leisure business is rapidly returning, even though industry revenue from corporate and international travelers — the domain of bigger carriers — remains depressed. “Low-cost, leisure-focused, domestic-oriented air travel has been in vogue like it’s never been in vogue before,” said Barry Biffle, chief executive officer of Frontier Group Holdings Inc., which held an IPO in March after withdrawing a previous effort to sell stock seven months earlier. The airline industry has never been particularly kind financially, with more than 200 failures or bankruptcies since 1978. But consolidation among the largest players since the 2008 recession set the stage for a comeback. U.S. carriers had $103 billion in net profits from 2010 through 2019, before the pandemic drove $46 billion in losses. The environment now appears ripe for new entrants led by entrepreneurs focused on keeping costs far lower than the entrenched incumbents and stimulating traffic on mostly uncontested nonstop routes. It’s the same playbook that worked for the previous era of low-cost startups like Allegiant Travel Co. and Spirit Airlines Inc. Shares of Sun Country Airlines Holdings Inc., a Minnesota-based carrier that specializes in Sun Belt destinations, have surged 69% since their March 17 debut, while investors have been cooler on Frontier, which has gained only 3.6% since trading started. Avelo Airlines raised $125 million from family offices, private equity firms and individuals, and plans to begin flights from the Los Angeles area on April 28. David Neeleman’s Breeze Aviation Group Inc. raised more than $100 million, most of it last year. “Low-cost carriers are proven across the world to be better businesses,” said Avelo CEO Andrew Levy, who was also a co-founder of Allegiant Travel Co. Las Vegas-based Allegiant touted 17 years of profitability before the pandemic ended that streak. Lucrative corporate passengers are likely to avoid air travel for some time as the U.S. economic rebound from the pandemic damage remains a work in progress. Leisure travelers, however, are returning to the skies, with more than a million travelers passing through U.S. security checkpoints each day since March 11. Still, the 1.4 million people screened April 12 remained well below the 2.4 million at the same time in 2019. In response to growing demand, American Airlines Group Inc. is adding 150 routes, a mix of new flights and restored service to regional vacation destinations in and around the U.S. Airline shares have mounted a major comeback in the past year. After a Standards & Poor’s index of the five largest U.S. carriers tumbled by two-thirds from a January 2020 peak to a trough in May, the gauge has since surged some 160%, though it remains below its pre-pandemic level. That positive sentiment extends to low-cost players that don’t bank on corporate or international travel and whose balance sheets aren’t weighed down by debt. According to the lobbying group Airlines for America, U.S. carriers collectively added $58 billion in debt last year. New entrants can take advantage of hundreds of aircraft that were pulled from fleets and employees who left during a rush to slash spending after travel demand collapsed. More than 150,000 workers voluntarily left the four largest U.S. carriers or took temporary leave. “It’s a time of opportunity,” said Peter Morris, chief economist at Ascend, the consultancy arm of Cirium. “You can get a deal like you never would have in 2019. The window of opportunity is probably not open more than a couple of years.” Morris pointed to JetBlue Airways Corp., co-founded by Neeleman, which went public less than a year after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Spirit’s initial public sale was in 2011, a year stung by higher fuel prices and slow economic growth. In Europe, discounters Ryanair Holdings Plc and EasyJet Plc rapidly expanded in the early 2000s while larger rivals like British Airways were cutting spending after the war in Iraq and the outbreak of SARS discouraged travel. Leisure carriers eschew direct competition with the behemoths wherever possible. They focus on smaller, secondary cities, avoid time-consuming stops at hub airports and fly less than daily to many destinations. Often known as ultra low-cost carriers, or ULCCs, many couple deeply discounted fares with fees for anything extra. “That’s what the ULCCs and investors are banking on — that spurred by these low fares and new, underserved routes you’ll see passenger growth at a multiple greater than GDP growth,” said Joe Mohan, an aviation consultant in Westlake, Texas, and former CEO of Grupo Viva, the parent of several Latin American discount airlines. Frontier’s Biffle also cites three rounds of government stimulus checks over the past 13 months, which helped boost the U.S. savings rate by $1.5 trillion, as a catalyst to spur a travel boom. Spending on durable goods soared in 2020 as Americans fixed up their homes, bought a car or replaced appliances, all while not traveling, United Airlines Chief Executive Officer Scott Kirby noted at a March 15 JPMorgan Chase & Co. investor conference. That leaves wanderlust next on many Americans’ wish list. “I think all that durable expense that would have been happening in 2022, 2023, 2024, you’ve already bought a new washing machine, you don’t have to buy another one,” Kirby said. “That money that got spent was pulled forward” and will prompt consumers to take more leisure trips over the next three years, he said. Investor funds aren’t flowing to airlines only in the U.S. In Europe, a startup called Norse Atlantic Airways is keen to reprise the trans-Atlantic Boeing 787 flying of the defunct Norwegian Air International. Another Norwegian domestic carrier, Flyr AS, raised 600 million kroner ($70.7 million) and plans to begin flying this summer. In the U.K., a budget startup named flypop plans to serve the South Asian diaspora by flying Airbus A330s from London to India, starting with Amritsar and Ahmedabad. Globally, ultra low-cost carriers command roughly 30% of total seats in mature aviation markets but only around 5% in the U.S., Mohan said. “ULCCs will capture their natural share, and whether that’s 30% or not it’s a lot closer to 30% than it is to 5%,” he said. Domestic leisure travel also holds the appeal of durability, said Lukas Johnson, Breeze’s chief commercial officer, offering a common travel scenario as an example: “I got a kid and my parent wants to see the kid and that demand does not go away.”"

The cities are making a very real comeback,” Kaufer said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. Hotel searches on TripAdvisor have gone up and bookings of experiences are going strong, he said, adding that people also plan to take longer vacations and spend more money on their trips. The Transportation Security Administration reported that it screened nearly 2 million people Friday at airports, ahead of the Memorial Day weekend. That’s the most since the Covid-19 pandemic started in March, signaling a rebound of travel as people take advantage of relaxed restrictions and expanding vaccinations. International travel is still lagging behind, and the U.S. State Department’s “Do Not Travel” advisories for most countries have affected the business “massively,” Kaufer said. “They are still not going internationally as much as they might have been in 2019. They’re just not sure yet how much is open, especially in Europe. But we expect that to increase over the course of the summer,” he said. Kaufer urges travelers to be patient with waiting time at airports and fully-packed flights.

The frustration was evident at a press conference outside the Capitol Tuesday held by a group of airline executives, union leaders and lawmakers from both parties. “I just can’t believe that we may not be able to do the right thing simply because our elected officials can’t come to any sort of compromise agreement,” said Doug Parker, chairman and chief executive officer at American Airlines Group Inc. “We’re better than that.” Earlier: Pelosi Talks to Airline CEOs, Says Aid Should Be Part of Package Without congressional action, tens of thousands of U.S. airline workers will lose their jobs on Oct. 1, just weeks before elections. An aid package passed in March provided $25 billion for the hard-hit airline industry to prop up payrolls. In return, carriers were required not to cut jobs and to maintain minimum levels of service. But all that protection comes crashing down in eight days. A broad coalition that includes Republicans and Democrats and President Donald Trump have been calling for extending the airline aid, yet it hasn’t gotten a green light from critical players, most notably Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she’d only consider the aid as part of larger stimulus package -- talks for which are at a standstill. Pelosi and Oregon Representative Peter DeFazio, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, spoke to airline executives and labor leaders in separate phone calls last Friday. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, chairman of the the House Democratic Caucus, said Tuesday he does not expect the matter to be addressed in a bill separate from a broader stimulus relief measure. “I know there are discussions taking place at a high level,” Jeffries said. “The Republicans are paying lip-service to the notion that we should step in to the situation but we really haven’t seen any movement in that regard.” Read More: Airlines Plead for Mandatory Virus Tests to Prop Up Demand The lack of action despite bipartisan letters of support and bill introductions is prompting unusually blunt language from participants seeking help. “Without a hard and public commitment from Leader McConnell to schedule a vote before October 1st, this is nothing more than election year political grandstanding,” Julie Hedrick, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants at American, said in a statement. “If we are going to save the airline industry, we have to do it now.” Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union, said in an interview: “We need leadership here to just simply do what every member across every party and the White House agrees needs to be done.” Four people familiar with negotiations, including a Hill staffer and industry lobbyists, said they’re not optimistic there’s enough time or political will to pass an airline aid package before the Oct. 1 deadline. They asked not to be identified while discussing the sensitive talks. There also has been some grumbling that airlines shouldn’t be singled out for relief while restaurants and other travel businesses suffer equally or worse, several said. Still, they said it’s impossible to rule out some kind of swift action that could result in new airline aid. “The way things work in Congress, it looks like nothing is happening and then all of a sudden it’s done,” said Dorgan, who is now a senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center and an adviser at the Arent Fox LLP law firm. Republican senators Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Susan Collins of Maine introduced legislation on Monday that would provide $28 billion in aid for passenger and cargo airlines as well as their contractors. No vote is scheduled on the bill and a spokeswoman for the Commerce Committee, which Wicker chairs, declined to comment on its prospects. American has said it will furlough 19,000 workers on that date. United Airlines Holdings Inc. will lay off as many as 16,000. Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. have said they will avoid most forced cuts for now after tens of thousands of workers retired early or took leaves of varying length. Joe DePete, president of the Air Line Pilots Association union that represents more than 60,000 flight crew members, said at the industry press conference that carriers can’t just “flip a switch” and rehire workers who have lost their jobs. Pilots, flight attendants and mechanics all must be certified by the government and receive training that makes hiring cumbersome, DePete said. “October is too late,” he said. “November is way too late. Airline relief doesn’t work retroactively.”"

A computer simulation of Airbus’s hydrogen turboprop plane. Every morning, Airbus SE Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury scans global air traffic data before checking in with carriers, suppliers, and the leasing companies that keep aircraft deliveries ticking along, even during a time of unprecedented crisis. Although the numbers make for grim reading, this meticulous approach has given Faury an unvarnished view of the aviation industry and the contours of life after the pandemic. This much is clear: Travel patterns have changed fundamentally, and so will aircraft requirements. The biggest planes serving long routes will be the last to return to the skies as carriers favor shorter trips with small aircraft that are nimble and fuel-efficient. Those trends could favor Airbus, which keeps expanding its popular A320 family of jetliners and is  considering a hydrogen-powered model for smaller distances by 2035. Both companies need to make decisions in the next few years that stand to shape the competition well into the next decade and beyond, yet they’re doing so from very different starting positions. Boeing can’t afford another misstep after one of the worst periods in its history. Airbus is generating cash again after a flurry of late plane deliveries last year. When Covid-19 struck in 2020, Airbus held $16 billion in cash and equivalents, vs. $10 billion at Boeing. One reason: Airbus kept its financial powder dry while Boeing shoveled about $40 billion back to shareholders via stock buybacks in the years before the crisis. That’s given Airbus an advantage, particularly in the market for single-aisle planes, the backbone of the civil aviation industry. The  coming Airbus A321XLR, a long-distance single-aisle model due in 2023, is already eating into orders of larger planes—and Boeing has no response. While it pours resources into getting the Max airborne again and services its $65 billion debt, Airbus is investing in designs that stand to redefine air travel. “You could say you make your own luck,” says Robert Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners. “It was a very deliberate decision [for Airbus] to not spend that money, save it for a rainy day—and it came.” Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun has hinted his company could introduce its response to the A321 within a year or two. A small team of engineers has continued to work on future aircraft, according to people familiar with the matter, including concepts for single-aisle jets that seat 200 travelers with the range to cruise the North Atlantic. It’s a niche where Airbus’s largest narrowbody jet is racking up sales unchallenged by Boeing. Boeing is taking a straightforward approach to making its fleet more environmentally friendly: looking at advanced composites to lighten the weight of the wings and fuselage and at engines that would  run on sustainable fuels instead of kerosene. Airbus could counter with such incremental improvements, but it’s chosen to develop a totally new aircraft it aims to introduce by 2035 that’s based on hydrogen propulsion, a so-far unproven technology. A hydrogen turboprop plane is gaining momentum internally, according to people familiar with Airbus’s thinking who asked not to be identified because the plans are confidential. The propeller plane would carry 100 passengers and have a range of 1,000 nautical miles—about the distance from Rome to Dublin. The hurdles to Airbus’s plan are significant. It needs to develop a massive global infrastructure for storing hydrogen at airports and fueling aircraft while figuring out how to make it affordable enough for airlines to switch from conventional jet fuel. Airbus’s development timetable means it has only seven or eight years to bring an entire ecosystem into being, and there’s no shortage of skeptics. “I don’t think we’re anywhere close to having hydrogen or electric power anytime soon on the mainstream aircraft, but I do know Airbus is working on these concepts very meaningfully,” says John Plueger, CEO of aircraft financier Air Lease Corp. He says Boeing’s approach represents “a much easier step.” The Boeing CEO has called out his rival’s strategy, without mentioning Airbus by name. Boeing studied hydrogen and determined it wouldn’t be ready for decades, Calhoun said on a call with analysts in January. Faury points to Airbus’s pioneering role bringing so-called fly-by-wire technology to civil aircraft cockpits in the 1980s. The system, which steers a plane using an electronic interface rather than heavier hydraulic links, was first deployed on the A320 family. “Fly-by-wire was seen as risky or too innovative,” Faury says. “Thirty years later it’s an absolute must. We have to be very careful with the ‘it will never work’ attitude, which has proven so many times to be wrong in so many industries.” Boeing is under particular pressure to defend itself in the longer-haul single-aisle jet market that the A321XLR is targeting. The Airbus model has already racked up more than 450 orders from two dozen customers, including U.S. carriers American, JetBlue, and United. Any misstep by Boeing or Airbus could also leave space for China to get into the market. Chinese aircraft manufacturer  Comac has developed a narrowbody jetliner called the C919 intended to compete with the 737 Max and the A320neo. The company plans to make its first delivery of the aircraft by the end of the year, and that could undercut sales for Airbus and Boeing in the important Chinese market. It’s uncertain whether China will emerge as a credible threat, but there’s still plenty of time for it to make its move. Given that aircraft have among the longest life cycles of any industrial product, the next battle for dominance will likely be waged a decade from now. “It’s a 10-year-long chess game,” says Vertical Research Partners’ Stallard. “You make a move, and 10 years later it plays out.” —With Siddharth Philip Archrival Boeing Co. remains restrained by the  recent grounding of its top-selling 737 Max following two deadly crashes and production flaws with another cash cow, the  787 Dreamliner. It’s also trying to introduce a massive widebody airliner, the 777X, which is  three years late. Airline customers have cooled on big aircraft they’ll probably struggle to fill, particularly with business travel likely to remain subdued for years. “We’re quite lucky that the change coming from the pandemic is fitting with today’s product lineup,” Faury says, referring to Airbus’s stable of jets. The Airbus-Boeing rivalry has long been about the first-mover’s advantage and the other side’s comeback. But the courses of the two players in the global plane-making duopoly have diverged in recent years, and the split has only deepened in the pandemic."

Many of the patients are senior citizens whose condition deteriorates quickly after the onset of symptoms, he said.  The pandemic’s impact is causing emergency shortages at blood banks in eastern Kansas and western Missouri, the Topeka Capital-Journal reported Thursday. In the Kansas City metropolitan area alone, an estimated 25,000 blood donors have yet to return since the onset of Covid-19, the newspaper reported. Chile announced a full lockdown in the capital city of Santiago and surrounding municipalities as the number of available hospital beds hits dangerously low levels and new cases remain high. Santiago’s Metropolitan Region will go into full lockdown starting on June 12 at 5:00 a.m. local time, Health Ministry officials said on Thursday. The Health Ministry reported that the 7-day average of new cases remain above 7,000 per day, and that there are only 30 intensive care beds available in the Santiago, a region with a population of about 8 million inhabitants. President Joe Biden announced the U.S. will begin shipping a half-billion donated doses of Pfizer Inc. coronavirus vaccines to countries in “dire need” in August, making good on a promise to lead the global campaign against the pandemic. Biden said Thursday the U.S. purchase and donation of Pfizer’s shots would be the largest of any single country so far, and that the vaccines would come “with no strings attached” -- veiled criticism of Russia and China, which he’s accused of using vaccines as leverage in their foreign policy. “We know the tragedy. We also know the path to recovery,” Biden said at Tregenna Castle in St. Ives, U.K. ahead of a Group of Seven summit. “The key to reopening and growing economies is to vaccinate your people.” Earlier Thursday, U.S. officials said the Biden administration will slash in half its $4 billion commitment to the Covax international vaccine consortium to help pay for the purchase of the Pfizer shots. Cameroon has used just 12% of its Covid-19 vaccines, with only 68,000 people receiving at least one dose due to widespread mistrust in the shots. The central African nation, which has received just over 590,000 vaccines, is struggling to inoculate its population due to hesitancy, Minister of Public Health Manaouda Malache said by phone Thursday. The country of 25 million people had planned to vaccinate 812,000 by July 31, he said. U.S. public health advisers will meet to discuss a potential link between Covid-19 shots that use messenger RNA technology and heart inflammation after hundreds of vaccinated people experienced a condition called myocarditis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will gather on June 18 to discuss an increase in reported cases of the condition, particularly among adolescents and young adults. Covid vaccines made by Moderna Inc. and partners Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s use mRNA technology. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine can be kept in a refrigerator for four and a half months, extending the shot’s shelf life by 50%. the U.S. Food and Drug Administration decided. As doses languish amid a slowing U.S. immunization campaign, concern has been growing that some shots could spoil before they are used. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is poised to delay the final stage of pandemic lockdown easing in England, in a blow to hospitality and entertainment businesses that want to see social-distancing rules dropped. Johnson is due to announce on Monday whether he will lift remaining curbs, imposed in January to contain a wave of infections, on June 21. Poland will reopen discos, loosen limits for hotel occupancy, and allow for higher capacity at sports events, concerts and fairs from June 26. Fully-vaccinated people will be excluded from density limits. Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said that previous loosening of rules hasn’t boosted virus cases, evidence that vaccines are working. Zambia reported record new infections amid a third viral wave, the health ministry said. The southern African nation reported 2,146 new cases on Thursday, with a 15% positive test rate, bringing the total cumulative number of infections to 105,909, with 1,332 deaths. The Japanese government is considering lifting a Covid-related state of emergency in most areas, including Tokyo and Osaka, as planned on June 20, the Mainichi newspaper reported, without citing how it got the information. The government may maintain strict virus measures for about a month until the Tokyo Olympics kicks off, on July 23, even after the state of emergency is lifted. An official decision will be made in the second half of next week. U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Thursday the Delta variant, first identified in India, accounts for 91% of new cases in the country. Earlier, a U.K. study showed cases have more than doubled in the past week. The data comes less than a week before Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to decide whether to further ease lockdown rules. Cases are higher and increasing faster in the unvaccinated population, according to the study. Moderna Inc. filed for U.S. emergency-use authorization of its Covid-19 vaccine in adolescents. If approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, it would be the second vaccine approved for this age group after Pfizer and BioNTech received authorization for use of their shot in teens in May. Both vaccines are now being studied in younger children. African nations need to secure at least 225 million coronavirus vaccine doses by September to meet a global goal of inoculating at least 10% of the continent’s population, a World Health Organization official said. “This will really require a massive effort as our early projections indicate that without a significant boost in the availability of vaccines, only seven African countries will achieve this goal,” WHO Regional Director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti said in an online briefing on Thursday. Earlier, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said the continent is heading for third wave, with the number of new cases rising 26% in the week through June 6. Goldman Sachs employees in the U.S. have to report their vaccination status by noon Thursday, the New York Times’s DealBook reports, citing a memo sent to employees this week who have not yet communicated their status. Bankers won’t have to show proof of vaccination but will be asked to provide the date they received shots and the maker of the vaccine. New confirmed cases in South Africa surged by 8,881 on June 9, the biggest jump in infections in about five months. The nation also reported a positivity rate of 16.5% on tests conducted, according to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases.“The increased number of tests and cases, and increased positivity are all evidence of the predicted third surge in Covid-19 cases” Danish lawmakers agreed to end most of the country’s restrictions by Sept. 1. From Monday, Danes will be free to stop using face masks in all situations except public transport, according to a statement. Restaurants and bars will be free to extend opening hours and all schools will return to normal capacity and schedules. The country will use a so-called corona-passport so people can show they’re either immune or have tested negative within the past 96 hours. India reported a record daily Covid-19 death toll of 6,148, after a state revised its tally. Bihar’s Health Department on Wednesday said the coronavirus had killed 9,429 people, about 72% higher than its previous reported death toll, confirming suspicions that the devastation in the Asian nation has been far worse than official numbers show. The U.S. plans to buy 500 million doses of Pfizer Inc.’s coronavirus vaccine to share internationally as President Joe Biden prepares to join other Group of Seven leaders in a campaign to end the pandemic by distributing shots worldwide. As Biden and other G-7 leaders gathered for the start of their summit in the U.K., their staffs were putting together a document that outlines a plan to end the Covid-19 pandemic by December 2022. At the summit in Cornwall, the presidents and prime ministers will pledge to deliver at least 1 billion extra doses of vaccines over the next year to help cover 80% of the world’s adult population, according to a draft communique seen by Bloomberg News. Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE will provide 500 million doses at no profit.

Domestic leisure travel will return to pre-pandemic volumes this month, John Laughter, Delta’s operations chief, said in a memo to flight-operations employees Monday. Travel restrictions across the Atlantic should ease in the second half of the year, he said, building on recent market openings in Spain, France, Italy and Greece. Delta had 12,940 pilots at the end of last year, excluding those at a wholly owned regional carrier. The new additions would mean an increase of about 8% in the number of pilots at the airline’s core operations. U.S. airlines have been expanding flights in recent weeks to accommodate consumers who are packing planes for long-delayed vacations and family reunions. About 20% of Delta employees took early retirement or left voluntarily during the height of the pandemic last year, and more than half took unpaid leaves of varying lengths. “This is all good news, but we should keep in mind that while our leisure customers are coming back, our fares aren’t back at the same level,” Laughter said. Delta has said it expects to report a profit for the month of June. American Airlines Group Inc. canceled 950 flights scheduled for the first two weeks of July after the faster-than-expected rush to travel led to crew shortages. The carrier also scrapped 775 flights over the weekend and into Monday as poor weather at three of its hubs worsened the pilot shortfall. Delta will start the first training class this week for pilots who had received conditional job offers before coronavirus devastated travel demand. The Atlanta-based airline also said it would add 13 crew schedulers and a supervisor."

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-25/covid-vaccine-passports-2021-the-golden-ticket-for-international-travel,2021-03-25T08:00:12.098Z,A Vaccine Passport Is the New Golden Ticket as the World Reopens,[],,"In a harbor on the Greek island of Paxos, Panagiotis Mastoras checks over his fleet of pleasure craft and counts down the days to the return of the tourists who fuel the economy of the 8-mile speck in the Ionian Sea. For the rental-boat skipper, the easing of travel curbs imposed as the Covid-19 outbreak swept the world appears tantalizingly close. Greece said it would  welcome back visitors starting on May 14, as long as they’ve had a vaccination, recovered from the novel coronavirus, or tested negative before flying out. “It’s the safest way,” says Mastoras, one of 850,000 people working in a holiday sector that accounted for almost a quarter of Greece’s gross domestic product before the pandemic, the highest proportion in Europe. “We’ve reached a point where it can’t go on like this.” Greece is at the forefront of a bid to revive travel with the help of so-called  vaccine passports—certificates or digital cards testifying to the apparent low-risk status of their holders—which is gaining traction in tourist-reliant economies from the Caribbean to Thailand. Businesses that have suffered a yearlong battering from the pandemic are also coming to view the passes as a route to salvation. The International Air Transport Association, which represents 290 carriers worldwide, estimates the industry could lose $95 billion in cash in 2021 after already suffering the worst year on record. So airlines have supported a  number of tech solutions to verify passengers’ Covid vaccination or testing results, such as the IATA Travel Pass app, the AOKpass from French travel-security company International SOS, and the CommonPass, which is being developed by a Swiss nonprofit and the World Economic Forum. A lack of standards could hinder such efforts. “There has been a lot of advocacy, but the execution has been sorely lacking,” says Jeffrey Goh, who heads the Star Alliance of 26 carriers including Air China, Deutsche Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, and United Airlines Holdings. A single set of standards for vaccine passes needs to be agreed to at the Group of Seven or Group of 20 level, Goh says, because vaccine passports represent “a policy choice for rekindling the economy.” Singapore Airlines has begun a trial of IATA’s app, as has Qatar Airways. TUI AG, the world’s biggest tour operator, says vaccine passports will be key to resuscitating its business. And Carnival Corp.’s U.K.-based P&O Cruises has stipulated that no one can board its ships this summer without proof of vaccination. In the U.S., American Airlines Group Inc. has signed on with the VeriFly app being rolled out by biometric software company Daon. United has developed its own in-house platform, Travel Ready, which will allow passengers bound for certain destinations to upload vaccination records starting in early April. Once established in the travel sector, such passes could hold the key to the reopening of wider society, advocates say, allowing business meetings and conventions as well as gatherings at sports events and concerts. Hyatt Hotels Corp. on March 9 announced it was exploring the use of VeriFly to help guests attend meetings at its properties. Ultimately some gyms, bars, restaurants, and even shops could also rely on the new vaccination documents to help patrons gain easier access. Yet the case for handing the newly inoculated pass holders their old life back is far from universally accepted. None of the available shots is 100% effective, meaning travelers with vaccine passports could in theory continue to spread the virus in crowded resorts. Moreover, some vaccines, such as Russia’s Sputnik V, have  not been cleared in many other parts of the world, raising the possibility that administrators of the Covid passports may have to make thorny medical determinations on which vaccines are effective enough to allow safe passage—even though health professionals haven’t settled that debate. More fundamental are questions surrounding the fairness of vaccine passports, which would inevitably  favor the inhabitants of richer nations over poorer ones where the distribution of shots has barely begun. And vaccine passports would initially open up travel to a cohort of the elderly and middle-aged that have been prioritized for inoculation, leaving younger people in effective travel curfew while their parents and grandparents jet off to warmer climes. President Joe Biden is facing pressure from travel interests including Airlines for America, the industry lobby, to introduce federal standards for vaccine passports. He signed an executive order in January requiring an assessment of how they might be used, but he’s yet to act on the request to establish guidelines amid concerns over privacy issues and the impact on disadvantaged groups. The Virginia-based Global Business Travel Association, which says its members manage more than $345 billion of spending annually, said in February that the White House should resist any moves that might “further cripple” the industry by restricting domestic air travel with a required negative Covid test. Although Americans have a handful of foreign-travel options, including to parts of the Caribbean and Mexico, which requires neither a Covid test nor proof of vaccination, the reality is that they will “all be going to Florida” this year because most other top destinations have restrictions, says John Grant, chief analyst at flight-bookings specialist OAG. Rifts over the role of vaccine passes in helping the world recover from the coronavirus crisis have been especially apparent within the European Union. Nations in the sunnier south are desperate to revive tourism just as others farther north fret over the consequences of permitting travel, in a continent where the virus has hit hard and vaccine distribution remains painfully slow in large parts. On March 17 the EU gave the go-ahead to its own passport, a “Digital Green Certificate,” but some key questions persist, including when the passport will be available (an internal memo has suggested in three months) and how long the full reopening of borders will take under a proposed tiered phase-in. Those hurdles suggest countries such as  Cyprus, Greece, and Spain may need to go ahead with plans to admit tourists via bilateral pacts if they’re to make the most of the summer season. The U.K. aims to permit international leisure trips starting  as early as May 17, and many travel-dependent nations are desperate to snag British vacationers once restrictions are lifted. Britain, along with Germany, is the biggest source of visitors to the Mediterranean. Visitor numbers to Spain were down 90% in January from a year earlier, underscoring the continuing woes of a tourism sector that’s typically 10% of the economy. In Spain’s Canary Islands, which sit off the coast of Africa and normally have a year-round tourist season, hotel manager Jorge Marichal is counting on a May reopening of his lodgings on Tenerife, a perennial favorite with Brits, after more than a year. “We’re pinning our hopes on the vaccines and the Covid pass,” says Marichal, who also chairs the Spanish Confederation of Hotels and Tourist Lodgings. At PortAventura World, a theme park and resort complex near Barcelona with 2,200 rooms, managing director David Garcia says he expects vaccine passports to unleash pent-up demand from international markets in the third quarter. But Michael Blandy, chairman of Blandy Group in Madeira, Portugal, which has stakes in 15 hotels, is less upbeat, even though the holiday island and cruise ship destination is already accepting visitors who can produce the appropriate health documentation. Blandy says that with inoculation programs moving at different speeds, vaccine passports may help only much later in the year when all of Europe is protected. Some nations are showing more caution about the use of proof of inoculation as a basis for reopening to tourists. Thailand, whose palm-fringed beaches and temples have made it the biggest destination for international tourists in Southeast Asia, plans to  shorten the mandatory isolation for vaccinated foreigners by half, to seven days, beginning in April. Nonvaccinated travelers will have to quarantine three days longer. The country, dependent on tourism for a fifth of its GDP, won’t scrap quarantines completely until October and the start of the high season, Deputy Premier Anutin Charnvirakul said in March. Bill Barnett, founder of hospitality consultants C9 Hotelworks Co., on the holiday island of Phuket, says that there’s widespread concern about the risk of letting outsiders back into the country and that vaccine passports by themselves won’t change that. “It’s a case of needing to win over hearts and minds,” he says. “There’s still a fear factor out there.” That fear led to pushback against early moves to reopen Phuket, Barnett says, triggering a drive to vaccinate the local population to achieve herd immunity. Economies where tourism is a more marginal activity have narrower ambitions. Australia plans to grant access to vaccinated travelers from New Zealand and Singapore, despite being effectively closed to visitors for a year and having barely 150 active Covid cases. Foreign tourists may be able to visit Bali again as soon as June, if they come from countries with successful vaccination programs, Indonesian Tourism Minister Sandiaga Uno said on March 18, though as many as 2 million Bali residents will need to be vaccinated first. The pace of the return of visitors from China will be a huge factor for Asian tourism. Totaling 155 million outbound tourists in 2019, Chinese are among the biggest foreign visitors to Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam, as well as key customers of luxury retailers in cities as far afield as Paris and Rome. International visitors who want to enter China could face some vaccine nationalism: China in March said it would  ease entry requirements for foreigners who’ve been inoculated with a Covid vaccine produced in China. No such vaccines have yet been authorized by U.S. health officials. The reaction to Britain’s announcement of a road map for resuming travel starting in mid-May suggests there’s certainly burgeoning demand, with TUI reporting a sixfold jump in reservations to Greece, Spain, and Turkey overnight on the news and U.K. discount airline EasyJet Plc saying  ticket sales have quadrupled."

Earlier, Labour leader Keir Starmer pressed him on the impact of his plan to lift most Covid restrictions on July 19. The scrutiny comes as millions of fans prepare to tune in to see England play Denmark in the semifinal of Euro 2020, bidding to reach its first major soccer championship final in 55 years. The European Union and the U.K. need to resolve their row over the Brexit protocol for Northern Ireland, Johnson said. While the two sides agreed a truce in the so-called sausage wars, a dispute over rules on moving chilled meats from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland, that’s just a “stay of execution,” he told the committee.  The dispute is “very far from fixed” and the EU needs to change the way it’s enforcing border checks on goods entering the U.K. region of Northern Ireland, Johnson added. The premier repeated his warning that he couldn’t rule out taking unilateral action to suspend parts of the Brexit deal if the argument is not resolved. Johnson struggled to answer questions from Caroline Nokes, the Conservative chair of the women and equalities committee. “You can’t point to a single policy or initiative that is going to help you build back in a more feminine or gender-neutral way,” she told him. She was referring to Johnson’s own words at the G7 summit in Cornwall last month when he said the economic recovery should be a “gender neutral” or “more feminine” one. Clearly annoyed, Johnson said Nokes would find fault whatever he was doing. The prime minister hinted at an imminent announcement on relaxing quarantine rules for vaccinated people who travel to “amber-list” countries. Asked by Tory former Business Secretary Greg Clark why double-vaccinated Britons shouldn’t be able to go on holiday to Spain, Johnson said: “I think that double-vaccination is a great liberator.” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps “may be saying more about that over the course of the next few days, perhaps even tomorrow,” Johnson replied. “I would not want to steal his thunder.” Just a handful of popular travel destinations are currently on the government’s “green list,” meaning arrivals do not have to isolate. The bulk of U.K. holiday destinations remain amber-or red-listed, meaning travel brings with it requirements for costly Covid-19 tests and quarantine. Questioned about the acquisition of Newport Wafer Fab, a Welsh-based semiconductor manufacturer, by a Chinese-owned company, Johnson replied that he has asked his national security advisor to look into the deal. Johnson added that he doesn’t want “anti-China spirit” to lead us to try to “pitchfork away” every Chinese investment into the U.K. after members of Parliament raised concern about China’s involvement in the deal. Johnson was asked about the government’s plans to phase out emissions from households by shifting the way homes are heated and also about heat pumps, the main currently-available replacement for gas-fired boilers. He was clear that “at the moment the prices are too high” for those heat pumps. “Let’s be frank, these things cost about 10 grand a pop,” Johnson said. “This is a lot of money for ordinary people. We’ve got to make sure that when we embark on this program that we’ve got a solution that is affordable and that works for people. We won’t be imposing it until we have.” The government has set a target for 600,000 heat pumps to be installed each year by 2028, up from 30,000 currently. Its adviser, the Climate Change Committee, says that to spur that sort of level, the U.K. will need to ban the sale of all new gas boilers from 2033. Ministers are currently working on a heat and buildings strategy, due to be published in coming weeks. As the session of the House of Commons Liaison Committee began, Labour MP Chris Bryant asked Johnson why he doesn’t often correct the record after making misleading statements. The prime minister suggested he did not think the question was fair, and told Bryant to be more specific. Bryant asked Johnson if he had fired Matt Hancock as health secretary for breaking pandemic rules, or whether the minister had resigned, as was announced at the time. Johnson didn’t give a straight answer, saying only that Hancock had left his job “quite fast” after the story broke. The government will phase out from September a 20-pound ($28) a week uplift in welfare payments under its Universal Credit program, U.K. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday. While the increase in weekly payments to the low-paid and unemployed had always been badged by the Treasury as a temporary pandemic measure, winding it down has proved tough for Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak because of opposition from political opponents as well as backbenchers within his own Conservative Party. That pressure led him earlier this year to extend the uplift until the end of September. “Ahead of October we will start communicating with the current claimants who receive the 20 pounds to make them aware that that will be being phased out and they will start to see an adjustment in their payments,” Coffey told the Work and Pensions Committee. “It is being phased out in line with all the other temporary measures that are also being removed.” Labour MP Tan Dhesi spoke of the personal sacrifices made by his own family in adhering to strict funeral restrictions during the pandemic -- and said government ministers had been “sycophantic” and “hypocritical” to support Johnson’s former aide Dominic Cummings, who broke Covid rules last year. Johnson said the government had tried “throughout this pandemic to minimize human suffering and loss of life.” “I apologize for the suffering that the people of this country have endured,” he said. “Nothing I can say or do can take back the lost lives, the lost time spent with loved ones that he describes. I’m deeply, deeply sorry for that.” Johnson’s former Cabinet colleague David Davis demanded to know when MPs will get a binding vote on the government’s decision to cut the U.K.’s overseas aid budget. It’s an issue that’s sparked a major revolt within the government’s ranks. The premier did little to calm the situation, telling Davis that lawmakers had already been given a chance to vote on the policy but “mysteriously” decided not to. That’s unlikely to win Johnson any friends on his own side. Johnson dismissed a question from a member of his own party asking the prime minister to support a diplomatic boycott against the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing by saying that he “does not support boycotts.” A diplomatic boycott means that U.K. ministers and officials would remain in the U.K. while British athletes still get to compete, in order to increase pressure on China to allow the U.N. to investigate genocide claims in Xinjiang. Questioning Johnson in the House of Commons, Starmer warned the prime minister that his plan to lift restrictions will lead to the “next big problem” -- self-isolation for potentially millions of people this summer if Covid-19 infections rise to 100,000 a day. “It won’t feel like ‘Freedom Day’ to those who have to isolate,” Starmer said at Prime Minister’s Questions. Johnson is planning to end virtually all remaining curbs in England on July 19, but the requirement to self-isolate if a person comes into contact with a Covid case will stay in place until August 16. People could start deleting the NHS Covid-19 app on their phones to prevent being “pinged” and told to stay home, Starmer said, warning that that would risk undermining the whole test and trace system. Johnson said the U.K. was moving to a “system of testing rather than self-isolation” and from “legal diktat” to “personal responsibility”.

British officials have been weighing up allowing people who have been fully vaccinated to return to England without the need to quarantine for 10 days after visiting medium risk destinations. Johnson signaled on Thursday that the government will move ahead with the plan. U.K. Poised to Ease Travel Curbs as Airlines Step Up Demands  “The real opportunity we all have now is to open up travel through the double jab,” Johnson said in a pooled broadcast interview on Thursday. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is due to set out the latest rules on which countries are safe to visit and those that should be avoided on Thursday. Ending quarantine rules for fully vaccinated travelers isn’t expected to come into force until August. Northern Ireland announced its own changes on Thursday evening, adding territories including Spain’s Balearic Islands, Barbados, Bermuda and Malta to its list of countries from which returning travelers don’t need to quarantine. Travel policies are often closely linked across the four U.K. nations. The Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, Madeira and Bermuda also joined Northern Ireland’s so-called green list for travel. “There are some airlines that have already lost another summer,” Willie Walsh, the head of the International Air Transport Association trade group, said in an interview. He cited Aer Lingus, the Irish carrier he once ran and oversaw as chief executive officer of British Airways owner IAG SA. It’s dependent on transatlantic travel and is in a situation that’s “much more difficult than others.” More than 60% of U.K. adults have now received their second dose of vaccines, fueling demands on the government to ease curbs on foreign travel to help an industry that has been battered by the pandemic, and give hope to millions of people who want to take holidays overseas. Yet the prospects for Britons taking trips in Europe are uncertain. Last week, Italy imposed a five-day quarantine rule on people arriving from the U.K. due to the rise in British cases of the fast-spreading delta variant of coronavirus. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also suggested the whole European Union should coordinate its rules closely and be more cautious about allowing travelers from countries outside the bloc with high rates of the delta variant -- which would include the U.K. Walsh said that since the U.K. hasn’t done anything specific to support the airline industry, “I wouldn’t be optimistic about them doing anything going forward.”"

Austria’s Foreign Ministry called the Russian move “totally incomprehensible” and appealed to Moscow for an explanation, the Austrian Press Agency reported. Russia’s Federal Air Transport Agency declined to comment. The European Union’s air-safety regulator advised airlines to avoid flying over Belarus after the diversion of a Ryanair Holdings Plc flight on Sunday, raising doubts about the Eastern European nation’s respect for international aviation rules. Skirting Belarus causes minor changes in airlines’ anticipated flight path once they enter Russia, for which they need permission from local aviation authorities. Other European carriers, including KLM and British Airways, have been allowed to land in Russia using updated routes. Carriers started to avoid Belarus earlier this week after its strongman President Alexander Lukashenko ordered the Ryanair flight to be grounded in Minsk, where authorities detained a dissident journalist. Governments from Europe to the U.S. have rejected the contention of Belarusian officials that the detour was necessary because of a bomb threat. Air France redirected its passengers to Russia’s national airline Aeroflot, according to a spokesperson for the French carrier. Russia is Lukashenko’s closest ally and he is scheduled to meet President Vladimir Putin in Sochi Friday."

The governors of New York and New Jersey both took steps to ease restrictions on crowds as infections and hospitalizations continue to slow in the metropolitan region. Vaccinated Americans may get clearance to shed masks outdoors in one of the most significant changes to virus guidelines since the U.S. first told people to don the face coverings to curb the spread of Covid-19. President Joe Biden is expected to announce as early as Tuesday that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will issue the new guidance, according to a CNN report citing unidentified sources. With the U.S. averaging 2.74 million vaccine doses daily -- with a total of 231 million given out overall -- some public health experts have called for less strict guidelines as warmer weather arrives. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said Americans should begin to see a turning point in the pandemic “within a few weeks,” CNBC reported. If the U.S. continues its vaccination pace, “literally within a few weeks, we’re going to start to see a turning around of the dynamics,” Fauci said Monday during a virtual event hosted by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. New Jersey starting on May 10 will relax some gathering restrictions, allowing bigger crowds to attend high school proms and graduation ceremonies, Governor Phil Murphy said on Monday. In all, 2.8 million people have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, he said at a Trenton news conference. That’s 60% of the 4.7 million adults whom the state wants fully protected by June 30. Indoor events, including weddings, proms, memorial services, performances and political get-togethers, will increase to 50% capacity, from 35%, for a maximum of 250 individuals. Dance floors at such events can open, but not those at bars and nightclubs. Outdoors, 500 individuals will be able to gather, up from 200. At venues with 1,000 or more seats, capacity will grow to 50%, so long as 6 feet (1.8 meters) of distance can be maintained among groups. The U.S. will begin sharing its entire pipeline of vaccines from AstraZeneca once the vaccine clear federal safety reviews, the White House told The Associated Press on Monday, with as many as 60 million doses expected to be available for export in the coming months. The AstraZeneca vaccine is widely in use around the world but not yet authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan imposed an almost 3-week lockdown starting Thursday. All students will enroll in remote schooling during the lockdown period, which runs until May 17, Erdogan said in a press conference following Monday’s cabinet meeting in Ankara. The daily number of cases should be lowered to below 5,000 so that Turkey can reopen economy along with the rest of Europe, Erdogan said. On Sunday, Turkey reported 38,553 new cases of Covid-19 and 347 deaths, bringing the death toll from the pandemic to 38,358. With infections falling to the lowest level since November, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he is increasing allowable capacity to 33% from 20% at outdoor stadiums, to 50% from 25% at casinos, to 50% from 33% at gyms outside New York City, and to 75% from 50% at office buildings. Cuomo spoke at a press conference at the state fairgrounds in Syracuse, where he announced that the fair, one of the biggest in the U.S., will resume this summer after last year’s cancellation. The fair begins on Aug. 20, and runs for 18 days. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy tweeted that he’ll make a “major announcement” at 1 p.m. on Monday about the state’s reopening efforts. Pakistan reported 874 deaths in the week ended April 25, the worst week since the pandemic started more than a year ago. The South Asian nation that neighbors India is going through a new wave of infections and government officials are warning this one may be the worst yet. France’s Emmanuel Macron gave some hints about how the country will start to reopen some businesses from mid-May. During a school visit Monday, just as pupils were going back to class after an extended vacation to tackle the virus, Macron said restaurants would reopen gradually between May and the end of June. He added that the timeline will be based on local virus circulations, potentially diverging from one region to another. Cultural venues would start to reopen from mid-May, with limited occupancy rates, and the current 7 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew might be pushed back, he told pupils. The EU filed a suit against AstraZeneca for breaching the advanced purchase agreement for vaccine doses, Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said in a tweet. The company failed to come up with a “reliable strategy” to ensure timely delivery of vaccine doses, Commission spokesman Stefan De Keersmaecker told reporters in Brussels. “We want to make sure that there’s a speedy delivery of a sufficient number of doses the European citizens are entitled to and which have been promised on the basis of this contract,” he said. Vaccitech Plc, the University of Oxford spin-out that designed AstraZeneca’s vaccine, is seeking a valuation as high as $613 million in its initial public offering in the U.S., a move to help fund the development of its vaccines for hepatitis B virus, human papillomavirus and prostate cancer. It’s set to offer 6.5 million American depository shares for as much $18 each, and will be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, according to a filing. The EU isn’t currently in direct talks with the U.K. on free travel options for vaccinated individuals. The bloc would be open to start such talks, a spokesman said on Monday in Brussels. The comment comes after Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the New York Times that such talks were taking place with the U.S. “On the U.K. side there are no such contacts yet,” the spokesman said. “On the U.S. side there are contacts on the technical level and there was also a call between Commissioner Reynders and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas last Wednesday where this issue was raised.” Seeking to speed up inoculations, Serbia no longer requires patients to register online before receiving Covid-19 shots. With a relative abundance of vaccines from four suppliers, the Balkan nation first lifted the registration requirement for AstraZeneca vaccines earlier this month, and then for the rest. The nation of about 7 million people has inoculated almost 2 million, including 1.3 million with both doses. The U.S. said it would send 60 million doses of AstraZeneca PLC’s coronavirus vaccine abroad, and President Joe Biden pledged his full support to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he combats the world’s largest surge in Covid-19 cases. Biden plans to announce on Tuesday new guidance on wearing masks outdoors for vaccinated people, CNN reported. A combination of curbing the virus and rolling out vaccines at one of the fastest rates in Asia saw Singapore top Bloomberg’s Covid Resilience Ranking this month, dethroning New Zealand for the first time in the measure of best and worst places to be in the pandemic era.

Uncertainty over the easing of curbs make it impossible to predict levels of demand in three or four months, and whether an envisaged increase in capacity to between 70% and 80% of pre-pandemic levels is justified, Varadi said in an interview Thursday. “We need to reconcile these numbers with reality,” he said. “It might be possible to operate within these ranges, but we can’t guarantee it. It’s not a matter of capacity planning but governments imposing restrictions.” Wizz’s assessment of prospects for the vital summer season, during which European airlines make most of their money, is in line with increasingly conservative projections from analysts. But it contrasts with a more optimistic view from EasyJet Plc, which said Wednesday it’s ready to ramp up operations and most countries are set to resume flying “at scale” in May. Global Air Travel Stuck Way Short of 2019 Levels: Flight Tracker Varadi said that while he’s confident there will ultimately be a rebound given pent-up demand, “whether this will happen over the summer or the winter or next spring, we don’t know.” Budapest-based Wizz said in a statement it expects “only a gradual traffic recovery into late summer.” Europe has been much more restrictive with air-travel than anticipated, the CEO said, citing the U.K.’s dithering over which destinations will feature in a May 17 restart, together with fallout from delayed vaccination programs on the continent that “could take them a year to catch up.” The region has also been slower to restore services than North America and Asia because its numerous geographically small countries have a lower proportion of domestic flights unaffected by border curbs. Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc. reiterated Thursday that it expects to turn profitable in the third quarter, buoyed by leisure trips and a pickup in domestic business travel. Wizz, listed in London and backed by Bill Franke’s Indigo Partners, still intends to be aggressive in targeting market share where opportunities arise and plans to stick with all of its 40-plus bases, Varadi said. The carrier also has no plans to reduce deliveries from Airbus SE, with 27 new A320-series narrow-bodies due in the next 12 months, though there’s flexibility to return existing jets to lessors or renegotiate terms as contracts expire. Wizz’s 1.6 billion euros ($1.9 billion) of liquidity should last it for approaching three years at current levels of cash burn, the CEO said, and there are no plans to raise further funds.

Sunday’s total of 1.28 million was the third highest since travel collapsed in mid-March 2020, according to data reported by the Transportation Security Administration. The airline industry remains severely depressed compared to before the pandemic erupted. Passenger volumes in the past week were 56% below the equivalent week in 2019, the most recent period that wasn’t depressed by the coronavirus, according to the Airlines for America trade group. That number has crept up, but only slowly. In the week ended Feb. 28, passengers were 57% below pre-pandemic levels, according to A4A. While new diagnoses of Covid-19 infection have dropped substantially since earlier this winter, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to warn against unnecessary travel. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser on the pandemic, said this is no time to relax vigilance because cases remain “very high,” speaking Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” More than 1 million people passed through U.S. airport security screening in four of the past seven days, according to TSA. The only equivalent periods with that many fliers since March 17, 2020, have been during the traditionally busy Thanksgiving and Christmas periods. The increase tracks a seasonal pattern of growing travel that occurs in March each year when many schools are on spring break, according to A4A data."

Deliveries of the planes will be completed by the first quarter of 2022, pending unspecified closing conditions and modifications, Atlanta-based Delta said in a statement Tuesday. The aircraft are more fuel efficient than those they are replacing. The airline joined other carriers in using the pandemic-driven slowdown to rid fleets of older, costly aircraft and generally moved to larger planes that put more seats on routes and reduced expenses for each seat flown a mile. Delta shaved about two years off of its average fleet age, removed four aircraft types and set plans to retire another 200 planes in coming years. “These aircraft are an investment in Delta’s future,” Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said in the statement. Delta will lease the wide-body A350s through AerCap Holdings NV, the largest aircraft leasing firm by fleet value, and buy 27 of the single-aisle 737-900ERs from funds managed by Castlelake LP.

(Source: Quicktake) Workers unload freight from a Qantas jet at Sydney Airport. People prepare to board a Qantas flight at Sydney Airport. Alan Joyce in 2011. Angus Whitley, Bloomberg’s global business reporter in Sydney, discusses Qantas’ pandemic victory with Juliette Saly on Bloomberg Daybreak Asia. There’s little mention of the virus that weeks later would lay waste to global aviation. Yet on the plane trip back to Qantas’s headquarters that afternoon, Joyce is already focusing on the looming battle. In an interview from his usual seat -- 1A -- he says he’ll do whatever it takes to come out of the pandemic on top. “It’s survival of the fittest,” he predicts. That was an early glimpse of the determined, even ruthless, approach that has seen Qantas not just survive the biggest crisis in aviation history, but become almost unassailable in its home market. While losses at airlines globally from Covid-19 are set to surpass $174 billion by the end of 2021 -- wiping out half a decade of profits -- Qantas has become one of the most financially secure carriers anywhere in the world. Its stock has surged 120% from a March 2020 low -- almost double the return of the Bloomberg World Airlines Index -- and its market value has swollen to A$8.9 billion ($6.7 billion). Qantas says net debt has peaked and it’s on track to deliver an underlying profit for the year ending this month. The 100-year-old carrier’s market position, Joyce declared on May 20, “is stronger than it has ever been.” Qantas’ muscular recovery from a crisis that was terminal for many of its peers is a tale of commercial opportunism and political guile. Australia’s improbable feat of almost eliminating Covid-19, not to mention subsidies for fliers, created a haven for air travel that Joyce has exploited to its fullest. His springboard was Australia’s shutdown of its international borders in March last year. The government didn’t just stop visitors coming in -- it also barred citizens from leaving. So within months, travel-loving Australians who’d normally jet off to Aspen or the Mediterranean started emptying their wallets at home in a domestic vacation bonanza. Qantas, by far Australia’s largest airline, was one of the biggest beneficiaries. The boost was turbo-charged this year when the government started subsidizing 800,000 half-priced airfares to support tourism. Air travel in Australia has become so popular that Joyce said in May demand was about to surpass even pre-Covid levels. “I don’t see any way Qantas won’t come out of this very strongly,” Ian Chitterer, a vice president at Moody’s Investors Service in Sydney, said in an interview. “You can’t imagine the opportunities would have presented themselves to the same degree were it not for the pandemic.” Joyce, 54, hasn’t held back. A former flight scheduler himself, he’s been busy orchestrating Qantas’s biggest network expansion in a decade, adding 45 routes during the pandemic. Sydney-Ballina is one of them. Ballina is a short drive from Byron Bay, the coastal town in New South Wales famous for attracting Hollywood A-listers like Chris Hemsworth and Matt Damon. Before Covid, Qantas hadn’t flown there from Sydney for 15 years. These days, the airline and its low-cost division Jetstar operate as many as 55 flights in and out each week to meet surging demand from Australians who can’t leave the country. A Tuesday evening flight from Sydney to Ballina this month shows how Australia’s near-elimination of Covid is working in Qantas’s favor. The 74-seat plane was more than 80% full for the 80-minute flight. That’s a benchmark for an airline at any time, let alone mid-week, out of season in chilly June, during a pandemic. In Byron Bay itself, small businesses from hat-fitters to souvenir shops said the flow of domestic visitors has helped keep them afloat. “Definitely a savior,” said 47-year-old Bert Reid, who’s run surfing shop Wreck Surf near the beach for almost 25 years. The holiday boom has been enabled by an unlikely victory over a virus that has killed almost 3.9 million people in the rest of the world. Australia, which has suffered fewer than 1,000 deaths, only has about 150 active cases and life has largely continued as normal. The country came in third out of 53 nations last month in Bloomberg’s Covid Resilience Ranking of the best places to be during the pandemic. Self-containment isn’t the only thing underpinning Qantas’s recovery. Australia’s vast land mass -- more than double that of India -- makes flying the only practical way to travel between most major cities. The 26-million-strong population also puts a limit on viable airline competitors. And Joyce, who has led Qantas since 2008, has been merciless. When Qantas’s closest rival Virgin Australia appealed for government help just a few weeks into the crisis, Joyce argued successfully against rewarding “badly managed” companies. Without the kind of aid that propped up carriers across Europe and the U.S., Virgin collapsed in April last year, riddled with debt after trying in vain to go head-to-head with Qantas. While Bain Capital rescued Virgin two months later, the buyout firm shrunk the airline’s fleet and relaunched it with more modest ambitions. Joyce soon went after Virgin’s frequent fliers -- the core of any airline -- with an offer to fast-track their loyalty status with a switch to Qantas. Those efforts are bearing fruit. Qantas’s market share touched 74% in December and was 69% in March, up from 61% before the pandemic, the competition regulator says. That’s a degree of dominance unthinkable in the U.S., where American Airlines Group Inc. leads with a 20% market share, according to March data from the Department of Transportation. To be sure, Covid-19 didn’t bypass Qantas. The airline estimates the pandemic has cost it A$16 billion in lost revenue, and its pretax loss for the year ending June will be more than A$2 billion, a figure that includes plane writedowns and redundancy costs. Joyce, who studied physics and mathematics at university, has had to deploy the bare-bones budgeting skills he later honed as the head of Jetstar. He’s cutting 8,500 jobs from Qantas and carving out A$15 billion in costs. In a statement, Qantas said: “We’ve been clear that we have to make fundamental changes to our business in order to survive. Our focus has to be making sure we’re in a position to repair and recover.” It’s not the first time Joyce has turned the airline around. In a three-year program that ran until 2017, he chopped 5,000 jobs, sold planes or delayed their delivery, and froze wages. That generated record earnings and splashed Qantas shareholders with dividends, but the profitability made it hard to argue for more job cuts. “It’s very difficult for a company against a backdrop of record profitability to talk about restructuring and wage freezes,” said Jakob Cakarnis, a Sydney-based analyst at Jarden Group Ltd. The pandemic changed all that, but the bullish statements from management while Qantas cuts thousands of jobs has rankled union leaders. In May, Qantas also announced a two-year pay freeze and offered voluntary redundancy to international cabin crew, in addition to previously announced job cuts. Teri O’Toole, federal secretary of the Flight Attendant’s Association of Australia International, says Qantas is taking advantage of the crisis to part with some of its best-paid cabin crew and reduce their influence on salary negotiations. “They’re using the pandemic,” said O’Toole, who’s also a Qantas cabin-crew member. “They’re telling employees how bad it is, but they’re telling the market they’re making money.” In response, Qantas said in its statement that revenue losses have been so large that “difficult decisions” have been necessary. “Job losses have unfortunately been part of that,” it said. Australia’s Transport Workers’ Union National Secretary Michael Kaine says state funding to Qantas should be conditional on keeping its workers. Most of the A$1.2 billion in government aid given to the airline in 2020 was designed to keep staff in their jobs, filings show. “Joyce seems to have quite a capacity to be able to move this current federal government wherever he wants them to go,” Kaine said in an interview. “He’s persuasive.” Joyce is often affable and jocular in public. Appearing with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on March 11 at Sydney Airport, he praised a government support package that included close to a million discounted air fares. “It has more components than an A380,” Joyce joked. “Thank you, Prime Minister, in particular.” But there’s a harder edge. Joyce famously grounded Qantas’s entire fleet in 2011 to tackle a labor dispute, leaving some 70,000 passengers stranded worldwide. Early last year, he threatened to bring in hundreds of cockpit crew from Asia if Qantas pilots didn’t agree to a new pay deal for planned ultra-long flights. There’s little immediate threat to Qantas’s dominance at home. Domestic revenue will more than double over the next two years, according to Jarden’s Cakarnis, who expects the stock to hit A$6.75 within a year, 43% above Wednesday’s closing price. Joyce’s biggest test may come from the Australian policy that Qantas has so benefited from. While the U.S. and parts of Europe are reopening to foreign travel, Australia is in no hurry. The government says borders are likely to stay shut until the middle of 2022, with public support for the closure still high and vaccination rates slower than elsewhere. International business generated about a third of group income before Covid-19. Just before the pandemic, Qantas was poised to push ahead with Project Sunrise -- the first non-stop services linking Sydney with New York and London. That’s now on ice. To get back on track, Qantas set out a three-year plan last June that included raising A$1.4 billion from institutional investors and grounding its entire fleet of 12 A380 superjumbos for at least three years. The airline expects its cost-cutting program to deliver A$1 billion in annual savings from June 2023. The plan suggests Qantas could come out of Covid not only stronger at home, but able to gain market share against international rivals that have become weighed down with debt during the health crisis, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Qantas looks set to “capitalize on the relatively soft competitive landscape,” analyst Richard Jones said in a June report. Willie Walsh, the former head of British Airways who like Joyce started his career at Aer Lingus, said the Qantas CEO has won wide respect in aviation circles. “He made a lot of brave decisions,” Walsh, who is now Director General of the International Air Transport Association trade group, said earlier this week. “He’s a very, very, smart guy.”"

Instead, it will chart its own step-by-step approach, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said. “What we want is to take a more middle path. Get ourselves vaccinated, that’s critical, maintain both containment and mitigation measures,” Ong said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Haslinda Amin. The country would “open up progressively, package by package, nothing big bang, and each step of the way, make sure we keep the population safe,” he said. His remarks come as Singapore plans to further relax virus curbs with larger group sizes allowed at restaurants from July 12, while it works toward a more expansive easing. The country has ramped up inoculation, setting milestones that are tied to more reopening such as having at least half its population fully vaccinated by the end of the month and two-thirds around its National Day of August 9. Still, even with one of the best vaccination rates in Asia and more first doses administered than New York and London, the city-state of about 5.7 million has so far maintained a more conservative stance on reopening, sparking frustration among some businesses and people over the cautious pace. Its exit path is being closely watched as a potential template for other areas that have contained the virus, vaccinated their populations and now want to rejoin the world. Ong cited the dilemma of so-called Covid-Zero countries like China, Australia and New Zealand that have maintained very tight border controls and pointed to their challenges of opening up because cases there are low and their population remains naive to the virus. On the other hand in places like the U.K. and U.S, there’s “so much uncertainty” when they open up. “You don’t know if infections are going to shoot through the roof and how would that translate into severe illnesses, even deaths?” he said. Government officials have said they’re drawing up a roadmap that plans to treat Covid-19 as endemic, and manageable as part of daily living like influenza. They are also looking to further relax rules around dining, office work and events, with more freedoms for those fully vaccinated. Ong said officials will have to think of a more definitive roadmap as Singapore approaches its vaccination milestones, particularly around loosening travel restrictions and changing its health protocols. Fully vaccinated people will be first in line to travel abroad for leisure, and it’s likely that only those who have been inoculated can go abroad when overseas travel resumes, the Straits Times reported, citing comments from Ong in a separate Instagram broadcast. Read More from Ong’s Interview: Singapore Upbeat on Hong Kong Travel, But Don’t Call it a Bubble The Straits Times Index rose 0.6% on Friday bucking weakness in the MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index. The city-state’s benchmark equity gauge rebounded after dropping 2.6% over two consecutive sessions of declines. Gains were led by real estate developers and investment trusts, sectors that will benefit from the nation’s reopening. Ong warned that herd immunity may be elusive because of more highly-transmissible variants of the disease. More than 3.7 million people have gotten at least their first dose, while nearly 40% of the population have received both doses. “To get herd immunity you may need 90-95% of your population vaccinated and we may not get there, not even a place like Singapore where there’s a lot of trust between people and institutions,” Ong said. “We may get 80% if we are lucky, which means it’s difficult to get to herd immunity, but what we can achieve is to arrive at an endemic situation where you can live with the virus.” Meanwhile, Ong said booster shots may likely be needed. He said in the Instagram broadcast that the country could begin to provide such shots around the start of February next year, according to the Straits Times. “The question is timing and also what type because you also need to respond to variants,” he said, adding Singapore may tap the supply of vaccines it has secured for some booster shots and any rollout of these jabs should be smooth. “We have a very close working relationship now with Moderna, Pfizer and other suppliers, and we are in talks with them.” Singapore Inches Toward Reopening Divided By Vaccine Status Singapore Eyes Mid-July Easing, Leisure Travel By Year-End Singapore Employers Can Make Jab Mandatory in High-Risk Settings Singapore Grapples With Reopening Plans as Its Rivals Move On"

He also said a decision on how to resume vaccinating Americans with the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus shot will probably come by Friday. New York state’s rate of positive tests dipped to 2.35%, the lowest since Nov. 7, Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. Hospitalizations in the state, once stubbornly high, have dropped to less than 4,000, and cases and deaths are trending downward. Another 35 people died, the fewest since Nov. 22. More than 41% of New Yorkers have had at least one dose of vaccine, and 28% are fully vaccinated, the governor said. More than 13 million vaccines have been administered. Turkey reported 318 fatalities on Sunday, a 10% rise from the previous day and the highest figure since the start of the pandemic. As the number of new cases continues to hover among the highest in the world, an expert warned about the surge in the number of critically ill younger people. Sunday’s death toll raised total fatalities to 35,926, official data show. Social distancing measures announced on April 13 have “started to decrease the speed of the increase,” Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said in a tweet. However, the nation ranks as the third in the number of daily cases, behind India and Brazil. “Better logistics” will be key to keeping the U.S. vaccination momentum rolling while the one-dose Johnson & Johnson shot remains sidelined, said Scott Gottlieb, former head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “The challenge now is that we’re going to have to set up better logistics to try and reach communities we know are hard to reach,” Gottlieb said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” The J&J shot has been seen as an important part of the national strategy because it’s one-and-done and doesn’t need special storage equipment. Still, he agreed with Biden adviser Anthony Fauci that “the J&J vaccine will be back on the market in a reasonable period of time - hopefully this week.” Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said cases may be slowing in her state, which has been hit hard by the virus variant first detected in the U.K. and has the most per-capita Covid infections in the U.S. While Michigan is starting to see “the beginning of what could be a slowdown,” she expressed concern about getting people vaccinated. “We are going to see, I think, a moment where supply outweighs demand,” Whitmer said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” The Democratic governor suggested she partly blames opposition by state Republicans for the surge, saying she doesn’t “have all of the exact same tools” to stem the outbreak as at the start of the pandemic. “And that’s why we’re imploring people to take this seriously, mask up, get tested.” Hong Kong will ban flights from India, Pakistan and the Philippines for 14 days starting April 20, the government said in a statement Sunday. A circuit breaker arrangement is triggered for each of the countries as there had been five or more arrivals with the N501Y mutant coronavirus strain within seven days, the government said. Under the mechanism the three countries will be designated as “extremely high-risk.” French President Emmanuel Macron said U.S. citizens will be able to travel to the country again in the summer. France is working on a “special pass” to allow Americans who are vaccinated to enter the country, in addition to an ongoing EU initiative to create certificate for European citizens to travel, he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” Macron also said Russia’s Sputnik vaccine was not a “solution” to accelerate France’s vaccination campaign because it will “take time” for the European Medicine Agency to approve and produce the vaccine in Europe. The U.S. is “in somewhat of a precarious position” with a seven-day average of more than 60,000 new Covid-19 infections per day, though vaccinations will bring the number down, Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, said on ABC’s “This Week.” “That’s good news, we’ve got to keep that up,” he said. “But we also have to make sure that people don’t throw caution to the wind and declare victory prematurely.” He also said a decision on how to resume vaccinating Americans with the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus shot will probably come by Friday. “I doubt very seriously if they just cancel” the J&J vaccine, one of three approved for use in the U.S., he said. Israel has lifted a regulation requiring residents to wear masks outdoors, due to the low rate of coronavirus morbidity in the country, the Health Ministry said. Residents are still required to wear masks indoors, and the Health Ministry has recommended that people continue to use masks in open-air gatherings. More than half the population has been vaccinated, and the number of new coronavirus cases has dropped to about 150 a day on average for the week, from about 1,400 one month ago. The U.S. added about 52,000 Covid-19 cases on Saturday, the fewest in six days, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg. Another 678 deaths linked to the disease were reported nationwide. The pace of U.S. infections has picked up since mid-March, fueled in part by cases among younger people, even as vaccinations have increased to about 3.2 million doses a day, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. At that pace, it’ll take another three months to cover 75% of the population. Covid-19 deaths, measured on a seven-day rolling average, declined this month to the lowest levels since October. A U.K. minister said it’s too soon to say if hospitality venues in England can reopen indoors as planned next month. The comments from Environment Secretary George Eustice on Sunday signal concerns that the road map out of lockdown could be knocked off course by mutations in the virus seen in India and Brazil. The next stage of the plan to unlock more of the economy is on May 17, when hotels, cinema and museums are allowed to reopen, and other hospitality venues including pubs and restaurants -- which were allowed to open outdoors earlier this month -- can serve customers inside. The European Union will try to coordinate a common policy for travelers from countries dealing with coronavirus variants such as Brazil and India, French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said. France announced late Saturday the implementation of a 10-day quarantine for travelers from Argentina, Chile, South Africa and Brazil, with police controls and stiff fines, to try and limit the spread of variants within the country, on top of mandatory tests. The French government will discuss these new measures with its European partners early next week, Prime Minister Jean Castex said in an emailed statement. South Korean authorities have identified nine cases of the so-called double-mutant variant in people arriving from India. The government said seven cases were found this month, while two cases were confirmed in March. Pakistan reported 6,127 coronavirus cases, the highest in 10 months, in the latest government data. The South Asian nation is going through its third wave with government officials stating it may be the worst. U.K. Environment Secretary George Eustice told Sky News that the prime minister’s visit will proceed in a “Covid secure” manner. Asked if India was being held off the so-called red list of banned countries to let the trip go ahead, Eustice said government scientists keep the matter under constant review. A Labour shadow minister said the trip should be scrapped, given the worsening outbreak in the sub-continent, the Independent reported. Poland reported 12,153 new cases, a decline from 21,703 last Sunday. The death toll rose by 207, compared with 245 a week ago. Malaysia added 2,195 cases on Sunday, bringing the total to 375,054, according to health director general Noor Hisham Abdullah on Twitter. Sunday’s cases are lower than Saturday’s 2,331 cases. Three new cases among a family of returned travelers were discovered to have been transmitted in a Sydney hotel. The infections, initially recorded as contracted overseas, are now believed to have been picked up from a family of four in an adjoining room in a city quarantine hotel, New South Wales Health said in a statement Sunday. Investigations into how the transmission occurred are under way, it said. The U.S., Israel and Australia -- along with Ireland, Malta, Gibraltar, Iceland and New Zealand -- will be the only countries the U.K. will list as safe for travel from May 17, according to research cited in the Telegraph newspaper by Robert Boyle, former strategy chief at British Airways. After the so-called green list, the rest of Europe will either be on the amber list, requiring home isolation for 10 days, or the red list, where arrivals have to hotel quarantine, the Telegraph reported. Several countries including France, Belgium and the Netherlands should be on the red list according to the government’s criteria but likely won’t be due to political and economic reasons, it said. India’s coronavirus epidemic worsened overnight, with the South Asian nation adding a record 261,500 new cases and 1,501 deaths. The army has been called in to ramp up hospital capacity, with a 250-bed hospital established in New Delhi run by the military’s Medical Corps, as medical services across the country report critical shortages of beds, oxygen and essential medicine. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been campaigning at election rallies in West Bengal over the weekend, is due to chair a meeting of top officials in the holy city of Varanasi -- home to his parliamentary constituency -- on Sunday. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said the outbreak in her hard-hit state may be easing, though she worries demand for the vaccine may also be slowing. France’s President Emmanuel Macron said U.S. citizens will be able to travel there again in the summer with a “special pass” for those who are vaccinated. India reported another daily record of new infections. Turkey reached record deaths amid an increase in critically ill young people. Israel lifted a regulation requiring residents to wear masks outdoors. Subscribe to a daily update on the virus from Bloomberg’s Prognosis team here.

Travel industry officials plan to hold events on Wednesday in London, Edinburgh and Belfast to draw attention to some 195,000 jobs they say are at risk from restrictions on overseas trips. An adviser from Public Health England meanwhile warned that a fourth national lockdown may be needed this year to control the virus. “It’s encouraging the data that we have seen from amber list countries, but at the moment we want to take an approach which is safer rather than sorry,” Kwarteng told Sky News. Johnson last week delayed the final planned easing of domestic Covid rules that was due on Monday until July 19, with a review to be made next week about whether the relaxation can be made on July 5 instead. Kwarteng told Sky News it’s “unlikely” the rules will be eased early, later telling LBC radio “we’re very focused on July 19.” Those rules are separate from the ongoing regulations governing international travel, which means arrivals from most countries have to self isolate as well as undertake several Covid tests. “There is widespread confusion, disappointment that’s bordering on anger,” Willie Walsh, head of the International Air Transport Association, said in an interview at the Paris Air Forum on Monday. “It’s disappointing that having been so successful with vaccine rollout, they have been so slow to enable people to regain freedom to be able to travel.” The number of flights into and out of the U.K. has plunged 73% from 2019 levels, eliminating or putting on furlough 860,000 jobs in travel and tourism, according to the BALPA. Last week, Italy said it will require U.K. residents to quarantine for five days after arrival to prevent new infections. The way European governments have handled the coronavirus crisis “has been a miserable failure,” and there are still many uncertainties about variants, Wizz Air Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Jozsef Varadi said at an aviation forum in Paris on Monday. “It’s still a roller coaster now,” he said, citing the U.K.’s recent U-turn on Portugal. There could be some clarity in six to nine months, Varadi said. Varadi and Air France-KLM CEO Ben Smith, speaking on the same panel, said they’re seeing stronger bookings. Smith referenced Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and overseas territories. The British government on Sunday signaled that its restrictions will continue and suggested British residents take vacations at home. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said “normal” holidays were “never going to be the case” this year because of increasing Covid-19 cases. “There are going to have to be significant trade-offs,” Buckland said on Sky News’s Trevor Phillips show. “We’ve tried to strike the right balance between the natural need in some cases for international travel, but also the imperative of making sure that we do everything we can at home to contain and prevent inadvertent spread of new variants.” The government will stick with the current rules until the end of July, dashing hopes of an easing by July 5, the Telegraph reported Sunday night, citing unidentified senior government sources. Health authorities sounded caution about efforts to ease the rules. Calum Semple, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies that advises the government, warned of a “pretty miserable” winter ahead “because the other respiratory viruses are going to come back and bite us quite hard.” “The extra time to vaccinate more people, get two doses of vaccination in as many people as possible will hopefully mean that what we’re seeing with this wave won’t look the same as the previous waves that we’ve seen in this country,” Semple said on Times Radio. Public Health England is recommending the U.K. move slowly in reopening the economy, allowing more people to receive two doses of vaccines. The rising case level now is concerning, said Susan Hopkins, the strategic response director at the health authority. “We may need to do further lockdowns this winter” if hospitals become overwhelmed, Hopkins said on the BBC’s “Andrew Marr Show.” “We should predominantly holiday at home this summer.” Conservative members of Parliament along with the travel industry are eager to rescue tourism before a second summer is lost to the virus. Liam Fox, the former Conservative cabinet minister in charge of trade policy, urged the government to find a way for those who have received two doses of a vaccine to travel without quarantine. “The world cannot be closed down,” Fox wrote in the Mail on Sunday newspaper. “Sooner or later, we will have to learn to live with Covid-19 just as we have learned to live with other viral illnesses.” The #COVIDVaccination programme in the UK has been a triumph. It is time to swap fear for optimism. Time to start rebuilding our lives and our economy. #COVID @DailyMailUKhttps://t.co/K8HXjQWida There’s also signs that some figures in the Labour opposition are growing weary of supporting the government on the virus. Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said there are limits to what the public can tolerate. “I don’t think we should take unnecessary risks at this particular moment in time, but it does need to be this irreversible process that the prime minister has spoken about,” Burnham said on the Marr program. “I don’t think we can ask people to put their lives on hold for much longer.” Those conflicting priorities are fraying the political consensus Boris Johnson has enjoyed on handling the pandemic, sharpening the focus on an industry that employs 860,000 people and has been brought to a halt by government rules. It has put the prime minister on a collision course with members of Parliament increasingly concerned about damage to the economy. “The U.K. aviation industry is the hardest hit in Europe,” said Brian Strutton, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association, said Sunday. “Hapless ministers give all the appearance of deliberately attacking aviation and tormenting the public with their mixed messages over summer holidays.” Under current rules, travelers who arrive in the U.K. must quarantine unless they’re coming from 11 green-listed jurisdictions, none of which are mainstream tourist destinations. On Monday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng suggested that’s unlikely to change soon. Asked about data reported in the Times newspaper showing that just 1 in 200 incoming travelers from amber-listed countries are testing positive, he said the figures “don’t tell the full picture.” Delta Variant Cases Soar in U.K. With More People Hospitalized Covid Counting Enters New Era as Threat Shifts Away from Cases U.K. Mulls Opening Foreign Travel for Vaccinated Passengers"

About half of attendees at a large annual meeting of accountants are expected to make the trip to Las Vegas this month, substantially more than the organizers anticipated at the start of the year. And some conferences planned in the fall have a full pre-pandemic flavor, with almost all of the speakers and attendees planning to be on site rather than over Zoom. “We are offering digital-only tickets, but are expecting about 95% of our attendees to be in-person,” Jon Weiner, founder and chief executive officer of health-care conference HLTH, said via email. “Attendee sales are trending as they were for our last in-person event (2019) and sponsorships are selling out quick.” This year’s gathering takes place in Boston in October. The recent pickup was captured in surveys of decision makers. In its second-quarter economic outlook survey, the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants found that about a third of business leaders estimated that corporate travel already has or would return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. “There’s been an underestimation of the bounce back” in the service industry, said Ash Noah, vice president at the AICPA. But corporate travel still has long way to go: It’s running at 30% to 35% of pre-pandemic levels, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. And it will take even longer for international business trips to pick up, with many travel restrictions in place to countries where vaccination rates are lagging and the delta variant of the Covid-19 virus is spreading rapidly. The urge to go back to in-person gatherings is tied to the fast-pace economic recovery in the U.S. after vaccinations ramped up and activity restrictions eased -- not to mention Zoom fatigue. Some airlines executives have said they expect a strong rebound in U.S. corporate travel after Labor Day, when many workers will be returning to offices. Here’s a look at the uneven corporate travel recovery: Global corporate travel bookings are recovering at a 10% rate week over week, according to TripActions Inc., a corporate travel manager that collects fares from ticket-distribution systems. They were up more than 300% from the start of the year, as of last month. The pace accelerated in June, as vaccination rates increased and offices reopened, TripActions data show. The increases are so large in part because travel was so restricted in the summer of 2020. Bookings are still far from back to 2019 levels, but they do point to sharp uptick in demand. Delta CEO Sees U.S. Business Travel Recovery by Summer 2022 United Airlines Holdings Inc. last month announced a record jetliner order and an ambitious upgrade for its aircraft cabins, expanding its hubs in two key destinations for business travelers: San Francisco and Newark, New Jersey. And Delta Air Line Inc. Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said he is confident the U.S. will soon experience a “renaissance of business travel,” with figures eventually reaching pre-pandemic levels. “No one is going to be waiting for the government to say now is the right time to travel,” Bastian said in June. “Businesses are going to be making those decisions and pushing their people out on the road.” Still, spending on business travel remains limited and concentrated on a few top U.S. destinations. The bulk of the travel boom so far this year has been for leisure trips, spurred by pent-up demand from consumers, especially higher-earners, eager to get away from home. Compared with 2019, 21 of the top 25 hotel markets had revenue declines of more than 20% in May, according to data from the American Hotel and Lodging Association. Urban markets that rely heavily on business from conferences and meetings, continue to face a “severe financial crisis,” the industry group said."

The global spread of Covid-19 variants recently has taken the shine off a rally this year in many travel-related financial securities, but investors are still betting that firms with stronger finances will put the worst behind them. Japan is an example of that. Its two main carriers, ANA Holdings Inc. and Japan Airlines Co., are both planning debt sales, and yield premiums on their outstanding notes have decreased from highs last year. The spread on ANA bonds due 2039 has tightened 28 basis points from a high in November, Bloomberg-compiled prices show. JAL’s 2028 notes have moved in a similar fashion, while travel agency HIS Co.’s 2027 yield premium has plunged 84 basis points in that period. Japanese corporate bond spreads overall have declined only about 6 basis points during that time, according to a Nomura BPI index. The companies dodged the worst of the hardship facing many global peers in part by taking steps to raise money in debt and equity markets since last year. That’s helped them ride optimism about vaccine progress in some countries. Other carriers in Asia have seen their debt securities slide. The price of PT Garuda Indonesia’s dollar sukuk, for example, has declined to around the lowest since January, as the company needs to completely restructure its business. The past fundraising by the Japanese firms to bolster their finances and the possibility that the worst may be over for travel may make their debt worth considering for investment, according to Toshiyasu Ohashi, chief credit analyst at Daiwa Securities Group Inc. Still, uncertainties remain high for the travel sector, with Bloomberg Intelligence saying that the spread of a Covid strain suspected of sparking India’s second wave may halt activity longer than markets expect.

The U.S. warned citizens to not travel to the U.K. and Indonesia amid a rise in Covid-19 infections in the two nations. It lowered the advisory for India, telling citizens to reconsider travel.  Fully vaccinated U.S. residents will be allowed into Canada as of Aug. 9, according to a plan unveiled Monday in Ottawa. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser for the pandemic, said the administration is “practically pleading” with Americans to get inoculated. In Texas, the second-most populous U.S. state, virus-related hospitalizations topped 3,000 for the first time in more than three months. South Africa vaccinated a record 223,969 people against Covid-19 on Monday, indicating that its inoculation program has overcome disruptions from widespread rioting last week. The U.S warned citizens not to travel to the U.K. and Indonesia, two nations that are seeing a jump in Covid infections. The State Department raised its advisory for both countries to Level 4, or do not travel, from Level 3, or reconsider travel. India, where infections are still hovering near 40,000 a day but are a fraction of the highs in May, had its advisory lowered to Level 3 from Level 4.  Virus hospitalizations in Texas topped 3,000 for the first time in more than three months, state health department figures showed. Medical facilities across the Lone Star state said 3,046 beds were occupied by virus patients, the most since April 12, according to the health department. The hospital tally has been rising for 17 straight days, the longest upward streak since November. Despite the surge, there were still almost 11,000 available hospital beds and more than 700 open intensive-care spots. New Jersey has reported 31 deaths among the 4,432,769 individuals who were fully vaccinated as of June 28. Though the fatalities were tragic, Governor Phil Murphy said, they showed that as complete doses, the vaccines are 99.9993% effective at preventing death. In all, 3,474 “breakthrough” cases were reported, demonstrating 99.92% overall efficacy, Murphy said at a Trenton virus update. Among those, 84 people required hospitalization, for a 99.998% rate of keeping individuals from becoming in-patients. Those who died typically had conditions, including weakened immune systems, that made them more vulnerable to Covid-19, according to Ed Lifshitz, a physician and medical director of the state Health Department. One individual, the recipient of a donor organ, was particularly susceptible, and the governor said her family “wanted me to make the point that transplantees are in a pretty unique category,” Murphy said. Lifshitz urged those who haven’t been vaccinated to do so for broad benefit. “You’re protecting not only yourself -- you’re helping to protect those people for whom the vaccines may not work as well,” he said. South Africa vaccinated a record 223,969 people against Covid-19 on Monday, indicating that its inoculation program has overcome disruptions from widespread rioting last week. Daily vaccinations last week fell to as low as about 137,000 as the administering of the shots was disrupted in Gauteng and brought to a virtual halt in KwaZulu-Natal, the province worst hit by the violence. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government presented a road map to reopening Canada’s borders to non-essential international travel by the beginning of September. Fully vaccinated U.S. residents will be allowed into Canada as of Aug. 9, according to a plan unveiled Monday in Ottawa. Tourists will need to provide border officials with proof of vaccination and a negative Covid-19 test completed before arrival. They will be exempt from the 14-day quarantine and two post-arrival coronavirus tests. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its advisory on the U.K. to level 4 due to “very high” Covid rates and advised Americans to avoid travel there, BBC reports. Florida Representative Vern Buchanan says he has tested positive for Covid-19 despite being fully vaccinated earlier this year. The top Republican on the Ways and Means subcommittee on trade said in a statement he was tested after experiencing flu-like symptoms and is now quarantining at his home. Only the most vulnerable children and those living with at-risk adults will receive Covid-19 vaccinations in the U.K., the government said Monday, ruling out a broader program due to fears over rare side effects. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be offered to 12 to 15-year-olds with severe neuro-disabilities, Down’s Syndrome, immunosuppression and profound learning disabilities, as well as children aged 12 to 17 who live with an immunosuppressed person, officials said. It will also be offered to healthy 17-year-olds within three months of their 18th birthday. The decision puts the U.K. on a different path than countries including the U.S. and France. The British position is driven by fears of rare cases of myocarditis -- an inflammation of the heart muscle -- and pericarditis -- an inflammation of membranes around the heart -- in younger people who have had the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he has no plans to renew indoor mask mandates despite a spike in cases stemming from the delta Covid-19 variant and a move by Los Angeles to again require residents to wear masks inside. The seven-day average Covid-19 positivity rate in the city jumped to 1.69% on Saturday, more than double the percentage of residents who tested positive from last month. The delta variant makes up 69% of cases sequenced, Health Commissioner Dave Chokshi said at the mayor’s daily briefing. Governor Ron DeSantis said Florida’s spike in positive test results is part of the cyclical nature of the coronavirus. He also suggested the problem lay not with people who were refusing to get Covid-19 vaccines, but with those trying to persuade unvaccinated people to get the shots. “I do not agree with some of these people, some of these ‘experts’ who lambast people and criticize them or say they’re stupid or something. That’s not the way to reach folks,” the Republican governor said at a press briefing. “Now you’re in a situation where you have folks who may be skeptical of it. Understand, if you’re communicating, you don’t want to say things that are going to cause them to retreat even further. And I’m sorry, there’s been a lot of misinformation and a lot of bad advice that’s been given by some of these experts over the last year. People saw that, they remember all this stuff. Have a little humility when you’re trying to carry that message. Understand there are some people that may have qualms,” DeSantis said. Malaysia eased virus protocols following the speeding up of the nation’s vaccine rollout, Deputy Prime Minister Ismail Yaakob Sabri announced on Monday. Office attendance in the public sector will be raised to 40% to boost productivity, and accounting services will be allowed to operate with 60% capacity, he said. Business hours for daily and wet markets will be extended from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. Ports, airports and logistics sectors can operate 24 hours, according to the statement. Malaysia aims to fully vaccinate all its adult population by October, the country’s prime minister said on Sunday. The U.K. will not adjust the National Health Service Covid-19 app to reduce rates of self-isolation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said. “The app is doing what it is designed to do,” Max Blain told reporters, adding that about one-third of the people asked to isolate after being “pinged” by the app then tested positive for coronavirus. Johnson, who is self-isolating after being a close contact of Health Secretary Sajid Javid -- who tested positive at the weekend -- will hold a press conference at 5 p.m. U.K. time. Pakistan has purchased 8 million Sinopharm Group Co. vaccines, 6 million Sinovac Biotech Ltd. shots and 5 million Russian-made Sputnik doses, among others, for August, health adviser Faisal Sultan said. The nation will have received a total of 63.81 million vaccines by the end of August since its vaccine campaign started. Pakistan, which is leaning on Chinese-made vaccines including 40% from Sinovac, aims to vaccinate 70 million people by the end of this year. It has administered 22.7 million shots so far, according to its health ministry. Poland’s Covid-19 reproduction rate, which represents the number of people one coronavirus patient infects on average, rose to 1 on Monday for the first time since April, Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said on Twitter. While the number of new infections is still low, the country’s seven-day average rose 13% from last week. Meanwhile, the pace of vaccinations is slowing and could grind to a halt in the next two to three weeks, the Dziennik Gazeta Prawna newspaper reported. Iranian authorities said government offices, banks and businesses will be closed in the capital Tehran and its surrounding province, as well as the neighboring province of Alborz, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported. The latest lockdown will last one week from Monday, IRNA said, citing a government directive. Iran reported 25,441 new covid-19 cases on Monday, approaching April’s record of 25,582. A female American gymnast preparing for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games tested positive for coronavirus, according to the city of Inzai, which is hosting the team’s pre-Games training camp. The city didn’t give the gymnast’s name, but said in a statement she’s a teenager who entered Japan with the team on July 15. The women’s artistic gymnastic competition in Tokyo begins on Sunday, July 25. The news comes after American tennis star Coco Gauff withdrew from the Olympics after contracting Covid-19 before her trip to Japan, and two South African footballers tested positive at the Athletes’ Village in Tokyo.

Here’s What to Know,['Jon Bues'],hodinkee,"With the Nautilus being essentially impossible to buy at retail in certain references, Patek makes the Aquanaut even harder to ignore. Source: Hodinkee Originally published by Jon Bues on Hodinkee.Pour yourself at least 48 ounces of coffee because, this morning, we have seven new Aquanauts to introduce, broken out across four main references. Ready? Take a deep breath: The lineup includes two new men's Aquanaut Chronographs in white gold (5968G), three new diamond-set steel Aquanaut Luces with quartz movements (5267/200A), an automatic, diamond-set Aquanaut Luce in rose gold (5268/200R), and another rose gold diamond-set version featuring a new quartz travel-time movement (5269/200R). The defining feature of the ladies’ Aquanaut Luce line is that diamond-set bezel – luce means ""light '' in Italian. This is a significant refresh of the Aquanaut, particularly for the Luce, with updates to the collection’s most successful aspects, including that new Travel Time option. Nothing here feels like a radical departure, apart from a larger case size in the Luce – and even there it's a size we've already seen in this fully blinged-out model. What’s most notable about the update is that it just hits so many watches all at once. The travel time is the single complication most associated with the Aquanaut, and now the Luce finally gets its own quartz Travel Time version. While you set the existing Aquanaut Travel Time via two prominent pushers on the side of the case, the new Luce Travel Time sets easily via the crown, which does not screw down (how’s that for poetry?). This watch, along with the trio of steel quartz Aquanaut Luces and the rose-gold Aquanaut Luce Automatic, come in a larger 38.8mm case size (compared to the 35.6mm size on the previous watches). We also have some new Aquanaut chronographs, a watch that's existed in steel since 2018's debut of the 5968A, which uses the same flyback chronograph movement. Now we have them in two new white-gold options that’ll make you do a double-take – I know I did. The new chronographs nicely mirror two existing white-gold time and date ref. 5168G options that also have khaki green and blue-black gradient dials. To my eye, the blue dial here appears a bit more blue-black in some pictures than others. You'll notice an integrated strap, already standard on the men's Aquanaut, but new for the Aquanaut Luce. Besides offering better visual coherence across all the models of the Aquanaut collection, men's and women's, it makes for a more genuinely sporty looking watch by emphasizing the curvature of the case and lugs. This is also emphasized by that bigger case. An evolution of the original Gerald Genta-designed Nautilus, the Aquanaut leans into its sport watch identity more willfully than the Nautilus. Its design feels more modern, with its composite strap echoing the patterned dial while retaining the spirit of the shaped case. While all of these watches are likely to do well, the two white-gold chronographs are the clear stars of the Aquanaut show. With the 5711 waving bye-bye this year, the next logical place for collectors to turn their attention is the Aquanaut. 38.8mm rose gold case with diamond-set bezel totaling 1.1 carats (48 diamonds). Water resistance to 60 meters. New E 23-250 S FUS 24H quartz caliber with Travel Time function. Skeletonized travel time hand for easy distinction from main hour hand. Easy second time zone setting via the crown. Pulled out one click, the crown sets the local time in one-hour clicks forward or backward. Two clicks sets the time and stops the movement. Matte white dial with embossed Aquanaut pattern, applied numerals, and aperture at 6 o'clock for day/night indication of the home time zone. Integrated white composite strap. Price: $40,216. 38.8mm rose-gold case with diamond-set bezel totaling 1.11 carats (48 diamonds). Water resistance to 120 meters.

The “removal and arrest of Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian journalist traveling abroad, are a direct affront to international norms,” Biden said in a statement Monday night, adding that the U.S. condemned the act “in the strongest possible terms.” WATCH: European Union leaders kicked off the process for adding more sanctions against Belarus. (Source: Bloomberg) Separately, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke Monday with the exiled Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. “Mr. Sullivan made clear that the United States, in coordination with the EU and other allies and partners, will hold the Lukashenko regime to account,” NSC spokeswoman Emily Horne said in a statement. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill Monday urged Biden to direct the Federal Aviation Administration to prohibit U.S. aircraft from entering Belarus air space after the episode, in which a jetliner on an Athens to Vilnius flight with Pratasevich aboard was forced to land in Belarus. “In an effort to keep passengers and crew safe, we urge you to prohibit all U.S. airlines from entering Belarusian airspace, and encourage our allies and partners to do the same,” Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, and Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, wrote in a letter to Biden. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement on Monday night that the Transportation Department and the Federal Aviation Administration “are working closely with the State Department and other U.S. agencies to understand precisely what happened, and what actions may need to be taken to keep the flying public safe.” Lukashenko has been the leader of Belarus since shortly after the country declared its independence from the crumbling Soviet Union in 1991. He enjoys broad support from the Kremlin and the Pratasevich episode could throw doubt into plans for a summit between Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. That meeting could come as soon as next month, around Biden’s scheduled visits to the U.K. and Belgium for gatherings of the G7, EU, and NATO, and would likely be held in Geneva, NBC News reported Monday. But White House press secretary Jen Psaki suggested earlier in the day that Russian backing for Belarus would likely not wreck a possible summit, pointing out that Sullivan and Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev held a planning call earlier in the day. Psaki said the U.S. would not “hold back on areas where we have concern” if the meeting materialized. European Union leaders hours earlier asked the European Commission to propose that Belarus officials be added to an existing sanctions list, as well as to develop broader measures to penalize entire sectors of the country’s economy. The sanctions could target the financial interests of President Alexander Lukashenko and his close relatives and associates, as well as businesses, according to a EU official who described the effort on the condition of anonymity. The plane was traveling between two member states of the union, Greece and Lithuania. Biden added in the statement that he welcomed the demand for sanctions and had “asked my team to develop appropriate options to hold accountable those responsible, in close coordination with the European Union, other allies and partners, and international organizations.” U.S. trade with Belarus amounted to only about $112 million in 2020, according to the U.S. Census Bureau."

Germans Roll Out Their Beach Towels,"['Siddharth Vikram Philip', 'Layan Odeh']",Business,"After lagging the rest of the world for 15 months, airlines in Europe are gearing up for some semblance of a normal summer. Still barred from the dash to unroll a beach towel are tourists from the U.K., where the government may change tack once more. Carriers are rapidly adding capacity in Europe to cater to the growing number of bookings, with  Deutsche Lufthansa AG  deploying  jumbo jets to ferry Germans to Mediterranean beaches. British discount carrier  EasyJet Plc said about 85% of its operations are now focused on Europe and just 15% in the U.K., in contrast to an even split before the pandemic.  Airlines are desperate to get travel going again after virtually being grounded since the early 2020 onset of the coronavirus health crisis. A vaccination campaign that's gained momentum after a slow start means internal travel within the European Union is being restored: from July 1, holders of so-called digital Covid-19 certificates will be able to move freely between the bloc’s 27 member states if they can prove vaccination, recovery or a negative test.  On Friday, EU governments decided to add the U.S. to a so-called “white list” of countries from which non-essential travel is allowed. The new rules will be in effect in a matter of days, as soon as they are published in the Official Journal of the EU. That means restrictions will be lifted across the bloc, including quarantine-free travel from the U.S independently of vaccination status. “We have redirected routes that were supposed to go into the U.K. into other European markets, because that’s where we see that we now do have that demand,” said Johan Lundgren, the chief executive officer of EasyJet. “There’s an extraordinary pent-up demand to go traveling.’’ Carriers are hoping to cash in on that rapid influx to help repair their balance sheets and raise vital funds. And there is evidence that demand is rebounding. Last week,  Lufthansa said it will deploy 364-seat  Boeing Co. 747-8s on two-hour trips from Frankfurt to the Spanish island of Mallorca after looser coronavirus curbs spurred bookings 25-fold since April. The jet will ply the route for four straight Saturdays starting July 17, with an  Airbus SE A350 wide-body flying from Munich. “If borders reopen and tourist attractions reopen, people will be excited to travel and recovery will look similar to the U.S.,” said Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen Inc. in New York. “Everyone wants some of the tourist dollars that are out there, and you can see bookings pop as the openings occur.” By contrast in the U.K., airlines are desperately trying to convince the government to allow travel to reopen after it failed to expand the green list of countries that can be visited without quarantining on return and unexpectedly removed Portugal earlier this month. As a consequence, British Airways said it would put staff back on furlough to preserve cash. Irish discounter  Ryanair Holdings Plc and the company that operates Manchester and London Stansted airports said they’d challenge the U.K. policy in court. They say there’s no transparency on how the government assesses travel risk, and the sudden changes are undermining consumer confidence. “The U.K.’s Covid travel policy is a shambles,” said Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary, who called for a “pragmatic” approach that gives an edge to vaccinated citizens. With Britain this week extending domestic Covid curbs until July 19, the government is likely to delay adding to its green list. But there were also signs of a reassessment. Airline stocks shot up on Thursday on news the U.K.  may allow fully vaccinated travelers to enter without quarantine from countries classified as amber, or mid-level, risks, including the U.S. and much of Europe. The government cautioned that no decisions have been made. Without a change, airlines will inevitably favor mainland European markets that are reopening fastest, said John Grant, the chief analyst at flight-tracking firm OAG. He pointed to EasyJet’s plan to move aircraft usually based in the U.K.  to Germany, adding that airlines need clarity. “Germany is open, so carriers can plan with more confidence,” Grant said. “It's a very strong outbound market in the summer anyway and there is a year-and-a-half of pent-up demand.'' U.K. travelers suffered a setback after Italy announced a five-day quarantine on Friday for arrivals from the island, and the restrictions include vaccinated travelers from Britain. July 19 is also a key date because it marks the start of the summer break for many European schools and hence the beginning of the region's peak travel season, Grant said. It's vital that trans-Atlantic services be restored by then if airlines are to make the most of demand on the key long-haul route, he said. Global aviation capacity improved almost 2 percentage points and stands at 61% of 2019 levels, according to Bloomberg’s weekly flight tracker, which uses OAG data to monitor the pulse of the comeback.  In recent weeks, the U.S. and Europe have powered the growth. China’s recent decline has stabilized, with air passenger volume in May almost double from a year earlier to 51 million trips, according to the country’s civil aviation administration. Last weekend, daily U.S. air travelers exceeded 2 million for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began, reaching almost three-quarters of the volume recorded on the same day in 2019, according to the  Transportation Security Administration. Capacity in the U.S. is now up to 80% of 2019 levels, with domestic flights driving the surge ahead of the peak summer travel season. But while domestic traffic in the U.S. is surging, international services remain limited, with the main destinations being Mexico, the Dominican Republic,  Jamaica, Colombia and Costa Rica, according to a presentation from Airlines for America.  What has been glaringly absent is the North Atlantic corridor, which links the U.S. with Europe. It’s the single most profitable route of the global aviation market, filled with premium travelers paying extra for first- and business-class seats. Throughout the pandemic, carriers on both sides of the Atlantic have lobbied  for a relaxation of curbs, a call they pressed during President Joe Biden’s meetings with world leaders in Europe during the past week. The situation is now set to improve as the EU lifts curbs on the entry of U.S. residents.  “This announcement should result in an increase in bookings to the European countries opening up,” said Anne Agnew Correa, vice president for forecasting and modeling at consultant MBA Aviation.  “As long as lockdown restrictions remain in place, the U.K. will miss out on the pent-up demand interested in traveling overseas.”"

Southwest anointed Bob Jordan, a 33-year company veteran, to succeed Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly next year. That means that all but one of the nine CEO appointments at U.S. airlines since 2016 have gone to insiders. And the list of winners doesn’t include any women or people from racial minorities. The record points to a dissonance at the highest level of an industry trying to shed its image as an old boys’ club. Airlines have been among the loudest corporate voices touting their diversity efforts amid a national discussion of sexual harassment and systemic racism. But when board directors choose CEOs, experience within the company trumps rhetoric about opening the door to newcomers with fresh perspectives that might elude the old guard. “The board didn’t consider ever going outside the company because the candidates we have who are ready for CEO responsibilities are right there within the company,” Kelly said Wednesday on Bloomberg TV. “They know the company, they know the culture, they know the industry. We did not consider bringing in someone new.” Experts from centers of innovation such as Silicon Valley’s tech giants and centers of disruption like Detroit’s fast-electrifying automakers need not apply. And while Kelly pointed to women and minorities who are already in senior leadership roles at the Dallas-based airline, he said more progress needs to be made readying the next-generation of leaders. “We absolutely need to get more candidates in the future who are women, who are racially diverse.” Others in the industry don’t understand why airline boards aren’t casting wider nets to find more diverse external candidates instead of waiting years to groom their own talent pool. “It’s a huge problem because you’re essentially saying that half of the people who have good ideas and good leadership skills are not qualified to have the job,” Sara Nelson, president of the largest U.S. flight attendants union, the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, said in an interview. She noted most carriers have extensive diversity and inclusion programs to recruit women and people of color into the industry but they’re not part of the public-facing leadership, making those companies less welcoming to potential employees from under-represented groups. Like banks, airlines are highly regulated and averse to outsiders, said Bill Klepper, a management professor at Columbia Business School who teaches a course on executive leadership. “They grow their own from within and that’s the reason both of those suffer from a lack of diversity,” Klepper said. Senior managers have “been there a long time, and if you’ve been around a long time, you’re typically a white male. They’re not quick to change.” The industry’s safety risks only raise the premium on institutional knowledge, said Samuel Engel, head of the aviation group at consultant ICF. “It’s 24/7, safety-critical with zero public tolerance for risk,” Engel said. “It’s not surprising that they bias toward stability.” There are a few exceptions. Delta Air Lines Inc. brought in Dan Janki, a 25-year veteran of General Electric Co., as chief financial officer this year. United Airlines Holdings Inc. went outside the industry when it appointed board member Oscar Munoz, a railroad executive, as CEO in 2015 amid a corporate scandal. Going even further back, Herb Kelleher, Southwest’s legendary co-founder, started out as a lawyer with no aviation experience. Meanwhile, the all-male airline CEO club could get its first woman as soon as next year. JetBlue Airways Corp. President Joanna Geraghty is widely seen as a potential successor to Robin Hayes, whose contract runs through July 2022. Diversifying the ranks may pay off beyond matters of ethnicity and gender. Outsiders could also bring experience handling developments transforming other industries such as artificial intelligence or cybersecurity. And airlines could learn more about improving their customer relationships. “Every time you put a new CEO in, you should look for the best talent possible,” said Lorraine Hariton, CEO of Catalyst, a nonprofit that promotes advancement of women in the workplace. “White males make up 30% of the population; they shouldn’t be 95% of the top leaders.” Air carriers may be hesitant to hire new blood, but other industries regularly head hunt its executives. Stephen Priest gave up his job as JetBlue CFO in May to take the same post at EBay Inc. Delta CFO Paul Jacobson left the carrier in November to join General Motors Co. as finance chief. Another Delta veteran, Jim Whitehurst, became CEO of software developer Red Hat Inc. and is now president of International Business Machines Corp. By the same token, airlines “absolutely” can hire talented people from other industries who would succeed in aviation, said Jude Bricker, CEO of Sun Country Airlines Holdings Inc. He was the rare outsider who won his current job after serving as an executive at a different company, Allegiant Travel Co. One problem attracting outsiders is the boom-and-bust cycles and lack of consistent profits that characterize airlines, Bricker said. “It’s probably an industry that you have to love to be in and I don’t think there’s a lot of people from other industries trying to get into airlines,” he said. “If you’re setting out to make money you just wouldn’t choose airlines.” Whatever the reason, insiders usually win out in the CEO race. Jordan’s promotion at Southwest came just a few months after Alaska Air Group Inc. transitioned its top job to Ben Minicucci, a 17-year veteran of the carrier. When Munoz stepped down at United, he handed the reins to Scott Kirby, who has been running airlines for more than two decades. With Jordan taking over from Kelly as Southwest CEO in February, perhaps the next transition at a major U.S. carrier will be at American Airlines Group Inc. CEO Doug Parker has been leading the company since 2013. His heir apparent: President Robert Isom, who first worked with Parker in the 1990s."

But for the pet care industry, business is booming. A Place for Rover Inc. said its business connecting pet owners to walkers and groomers is growing rapidly, closely tracking the rebound in airline trips. It’s one of myriad of real-time indicators of which places are opening up first and also shows some changes in behavior that may stick long after the last coronavirus rules are lifted. Rover found a bigger reluctance to leave pets alone for long hours, suggesting people tightened bonds with their pets during lockdown. That may both add to the financial cost and emotional reluctance of workers to return to offices. “Prior to the pandemic, people may have felt perfectly comfortable leaving their pets alone for eight hours,” Rover’s Chief Executive Officer Aaron Easterly said in an interview. “But with people spending 24 hours a day around their pets, we think there’s some signs people don’t feel comfortable leaving them alone for eight or 10 hours.” Rover is the biggest of a handful of pet service apps, which also include Pets4Homes and BorrowMyDoggy. Easterly said Rover’s data are “a pretty good predictor of the return to normalcy,” and in the U.S. “the correlation with travel is almost mind-boggling.” The gains are relief for Rover, which is based in Seattle, after its annual revenue dropped by almost half last year when the virus hit to $48 million. The pandemic wasn’t all bad news for Easterly. To profit from the wave of “pandemic puppies” adopted during lockdowns, in February, Rover agreed to a blank-check “SPAC” deal with Nebula Caravel Acquisition Corp. that valued the platform at $1.63 billion. Easterly is seeing more requests for dog walking at what once were off-peak times. More bookings come in between 12 p.m. and 3 p.m. or from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. This to him indicates that people are working from home at least part of the time. They may have realized they “may not love doing multiple jobs simultaneously, none of them well.” The company’s U.K. arm, set up in 2018, has recovered faster than other European markets. Easterly attributes that to the success of the British vaccine rollout. Gross bookings value rose 230% from January to June, to 10% higher than June 2019 levels -- before the pandemic. Rover surged even faster in the U.S., partly because it’s on home turf, but also because the country is less dominated by urban centers. Easterly speculates life can return to normal sooner in places with lower population density and less exposure to airborne viruses. The biggest risk to Rover -- and so to the revival of economies -- is vaccine hesitancy and the potential resistance of new variants to vaccines. Nonetheless, Easterly says he isn’t worried that more companies allowing dogs at work will threaten his business. “It’d mean pet adoptions would go up because pets were accepted in more places,” he said. “Our mission is to make it possible for everyone to experience the unconditional love of pets in their lives.”"

A White House statement late Friday said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention isn’t recommending testing and that Biden will follow their lead. “President Biden has taken a number of steps to make travel safer since coming into office, including requiring masking on all air travel and public transit, pre-departure testing for inbound international travel and self-quarantine and testing after international travel,” White House spokesman Kevin Munoz said in a statement. “At this time, CDC is not recommending required point of departure testing for domestic travel. As always, we will follow the science to bring this pandemic to an end.” The statement comes after the notion of pre-flight testing was floated by CDC director Rochelle Walensky and by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who was asked about it and said it was an ongoing discussion with the CDC. That touched off an outcry from airlines and unions, with the industry already under heavy pressure from a steep drop in travel due to the pandemic. Earlier: Biden Team Cool to Preflight Virus Tests Floated by DOT, CDC Biden has made fighting the pandemic his top priority, giving scientists regular public platforms to warn of the risks, ordering more vaccine doses and imploring Americans to wear masks until at least the end of April. Earlier Friday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki also cast doubt on the measure being imposed. “Reports that there is an intention to put in place new requirements such as testing are not accurate,” she said. U.S. airline executives met Friday with Jeff Zients, a Biden aide who serves as Covid-19 response coordinator. U.S. coronavirus cases and hospitalizations have fallen significantly in the past month as the pace of vaccinations has increased -- though new, more contagious variants of the disease have emerged and have already been detected on American soil. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a Covid adviser to Biden, has said that the B117 variant found originally in the U.K. could become the dominant strain in the U.S. by late March, thus threatening to reignite the pandemic. The U.S. has already imposed testing requirements on international flights bound for the U.S., along with wider restrictions on travel from certain regions in an effort to slow the spread of the virus and its emerging variants. Read More: CDC Sets Guidance for Schools to Reopen Safely in Pandemic Discussion about testing comes as Congress considers another $15 billion in federal payroll aid that has helped avoid widespread airline employee furloughs. The government thus far has provided about $35 billion in grants and loans to 10 of the largest carriers to cover employee costs, according to figures compiled by Savanthi Syth, a Raymond James Financial Inc. analyst. Also on Friday, the CDC issued guidance on ways to put students back in schools. The agency outlined mitigation strategies that include the proper use of masks, social distancing of six feet, strict cleaning and maintenance of classrooms, and rapid contact tracing. And while the guidance doesn’t mandate reopenings, the CDC calls it “critical for schools to open as safely and as quickly as possible for in-person learning.”"

A further announcement on the travel corridor should be made on or before June 13, the Hong Kong government said in a statement Monday. Singapore Minister for Transport S. Iswaran said that as the island nation is unable to meet the criteria to start the travel bubble, both sides have agreed to defer the launch, which was due to start May 26. Both governments remain committed to the arrangement, “with a view to resuming air travel between the two regional aviation hubs and international cities in a gradual and orderly manner under a set of stringent public health control protocols,” the Hong Kong government said in its statement. Singapore’s government last week imposed lockdown-like restrictions for a month until June 13 amid a rise in untraceable virus infections. The biggest number of new cases are linked to a cluster at Changi Airport, which prompted the closure of two terminals and the Jewel shopping complex for two weeks. Dining in restaurants is also banned. The spike in cases prompted Hong Kong to reclassify Singapore as a high-risk destination, joining six other countries including Argentina, Italy and Kenya, according to a statement Monday. That means arrivals to Hong Kong from Singapore must quarantine at designated hotels for 21 days as well as present proof of a negative coronavirus test before boarding their flights. The quarantine is reduced to 14 days for fully vaccinated travelers. The bubble, which would have permitted quarantine-free travel betwen the two cities, was to involve special flights on Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. Both airlines have been hurt particularly hard during the pandemic because neither has any domestic market upon which to rely. With international travel all but off limits, passenger numbers have plummeted, inflicting severe financial pain on the carriers. Shares in Singapore Airlines closed up 3.1% on Monday while Cathay Pacific dipped 0.5%. While it is disappointed by the delay, Cathay is “encouraged by the demand for two-way, all-purpose, quarantine-free air travel flight arrangements among our customers,” the airline said in a statement. Tickets on the initial flights between Singapore and Hong Kong were almost sold out in both directions. Cathay separately said it is introducing a new organizational structure for its Hong Kong International Airport team that will take effect from Sept. 1. The new structure will “create clearer roles and responsibilities, build more flexibility into our manpower deployment plans, as well as put a stronger focus on the frontline leadership team,” the airline said. The changes won’t involve any involuntary redundancies, it added. Singapore Airlines said in a statement that it supports the decision to delay the bubble launch. Of the 17 unlinked cases identified in Singapore on Sunday, six patients preliminarily tested positive for the B.1.617 strain, according to Ministry of Health data. Among them, two had already gotten their first vaccine dose. In all, Singapore reported 38 new cases of Covid-19 infection in the community on Sunday, the highest in more than a year. On Monday, another 21 cases were found with 11 that aren’t linked to any existing clusters. For four weeks from May 16 to June 13, gathering sizes as well as household visitors will be cut to a maximum of two people from five, working from home will be the default, and food places can only do takeaways and deliveries. On Sunday, Singapore further announced it will stop most in-person school classes this week, with the education minister saying some of the variants appear to attack younger children. The flareup is a major setback by Singapore standards considering the city-state is one of a handful of “Covid havens” that had previously nearly eliminated the pathogen domestically. These places are now struggling to find a path to re-open as their vaccination drives lag major Western economies. The quarantine-free air travel arrangement was initially set to start last November but was first delayed by rising cases in Hong Kong. Under the agreement, if the seven-day moving average of the daily number of unlinked local cases is more than five in either Singapore or Hong Kong, the bubble will be suspended for two weeks. Currently, that number is hovering around 4.7. Travelers with bookings on designated flights during the period have been advised to contact their airlines and adjust their itineraries."

The U.K. is set to scrap quarantine measures for fully vaccinated people who’ve been in contact with someone infected with Covid-19, the Times reported, without saying where it got the information. Instead of following the U.K.’s current rules of self-isolating for 10 days, anyone fully vaccinated who’s come into contact with a positive case would instead be advised to take daily tests, the Times said. Government officials will meet Monday to sign off on the proposals and look to introduce them next month, according to the paper. Official estimates indicate the U.K.’s infection rate will surge as much as 26% under the measures, but the government is expected to accept the risk to prevent further disruptions to daily life, the Times reported. A U.K. government representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment by Bloomberg. Malaysia said five states will move into the second phase of the national recovery plan from Monday, after meeting threshold limits in reducing Covid infections. The country posted 6,658 new cases on Saturday, with Selangor, the most-industrialized state, alone accounting for about half the tally. The five states set to move to the second phase posted fewer than 500 cases combined, health ministry data showed. Indonesia reported record daily Covid-19 cases on Saturday as it kicked off a “micro” lockdown that shut malls, banned public gatherings and restricted travel in the Java and Bali islands. The nation added 27,913 new infections to take its total to nearly 2.3 million, the most in Southeast Asia. Health authorities expect the surge to peak in the first week of July and begin flattening after that. The government plans to work with telecommunications providers and other agencies to track mobility, and local authorities will be called on to enforce curbs properly if public activity is still high, according to Jodi Mahardi, spokesman for the coordinating ministry for maritime and investment affairs. Belgium reported its first increase in cases in months, with an average of 378 new infections per day, up 5% on a weekly average from June 23-29. Testing increased by 23% on a weekly basis, as summer vacations get under way. Average deaths per day stood at four and hospitalizations at 16 -- both a decline from the week before. Health officials reported a 1% positivity rate out of all people tested. More than 60% of the total population has received at least one vaccination dose. Russia reported record-high deaths from Covid-19 for a fifth straight day on Saturday, with 697 fatalities, according to data from the state-run monitoring center. That’s up from 679 previously. The number of new cases in the past day rose to 24,439, the highest level since January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Japan’s capital reported 716 new cases Saturday, the highest number in more than five weeks. The seven-day average of new cases rose to 563.1, in a worrying sign as Japan prepares to host the Tokyo Olympics in less than three weeks. The new cases remained largely among people in their 20s and 30s, with only 40 new patients over the age of 65. The number of serious cases fell to 50, from 54 the previous day. The Bangladesh government received 4.5 million Covid vaccine doses, bolstering inoculation efforts amid a surge in virus cases and deaths across the South Asian nation. The U.S. delivered 2.5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine under the Covax initiative, the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka said in a statement on Saturday. Separately, Bangladesh received 2 million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine, part of the government’s plan to purchase 15 million doses from the Chinese drug maker, the foreign ministry in Dhaka said in a statement. Inoculations in Bangladesh slowed to a crawl after India banned vaccine exports. Bangladesh deployed troops alongside other security forces to enforce a stringent lockdown amid the spike in cases. Bangladesh on Friday reported 132 new deaths from the disease, taking the toll to 14,778, as cases surged by 8,483 to 930,042. South African regulators have approved Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s coronavirus vaccine, the first shot developed for the disease by a Chinese company to be sanctioned locally. The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority backed the double-dose CoronaVac candidate made by Sinovac’s Life Sciences unit with conditions, according to a statement on Saturday. Those include satisfactory results of ongoing studies and periodic safety updates, SAHPRA said. The conditional approval comes as the number of South African daily cases surged to a record. President Cyril Ramaphosa has placed the country in the strictest form of lockdown since May 2020 as the nation grapples with a surge in infections driven by the delta variant. A health worker administers a nasal swab at a Testaro Covid-19 mobile testing site in the Sandton suburb of Johannesburg on July 1. The World Health Organization authorized the Sinovac vaccine on June 1, paving the way for a wider roll-out in countries scrambling for a supply of immunizations. Phase 3 trial data for the Covaxin vaccine shows 77.8% efficacy at preventing symptomatic infections and 93.4% for severe symptoms, according to data released by India’s Bharat Biotech International Ltd. and its partner Ocugen. The final analysis is similar to interim data in April. Covaxin was rolled out in India earlier this year. The two-shot injection that uses an inactivated or dead form of the virus showed 65.2% protection against the delta variant, the company said Saturday. Safety analysis showed serious adverse effects in fewer than 0.5% of subjects. Virus cases in the South Korean capital and its metropolitan area hovered above 600 for a fourth day, according to data from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, more than doubling from two weeks ago when authorities announced plans to relax social-distancing rules. Measures that would allow restaurants and bars to extend indoor dining and raise the cap on the number of people permitted to gather were scheduled to be introduced nationwide at the start of July. But provincial governments in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi Province held off the adoption of those plans by at least a week, due to the recent spike in cases in the region. Attendees at the Beautiful Mint Life 2021 music festival at the Olympic Park in Seoul on June 26. Overall, South Korea reported 794 cases nationwide Saturday, down from 826 on Friday when it reported its biggest daily jump in about half a year. Seoul and its metropolitan area were responsible for most of the cases with 614. Forced evacuation of hundreds of residents near the Philippines’ Taal volcano, which threatens to erupt after spewing kilometer-high steam and fragments in recent days, could complicate the nation’s fight against coronavirus. Local governments in Batangas province where the volcano is located are appealing to the central government to prioritize vaccine delivery to small villages affected by Taal to prevent infections in evacuation centers. About 1,300 residents have been evacuated as of Friday. Senator Joel Villanueva urged the government to prepare for possible delays in vaccine shipments due to disruptions on inbound and outbound flights should Taal erupt, the Philippine Star reported. Nevada is reporting the highest-in-the nation rate of new cases, just as the gambling mecca of Las Vegas prepares for what could be its biggest weekends since reopening. The state ranked first in the U.S. with almost 112 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The average daily hospital admissions have jumped 44% from a week earlier to about 55 a day, with a surprising increase in the 30-to-39-year-old cohort. Employers in Singapore should not make getting a Covid-19 vaccination mandatory, but may do so for those working in high-risk settings, according to an advisory from the government, unions and employers. The advisory states that while an employer may not terminate an employee in such a setting for refusing the vaccine, they may redeploy them to another job with lower risk of infection. Argentina is changing local vaccine regulations to speed access to a wider range of vaccines including those made by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna Inc. and Johnson & Johnson, as the Biden administration steps up donations. The government on Saturday will publish a presidential decree aimed at smoothing over certain legal and technical terminology, to find a middle ground between labs’ needs and government interests, according to a Friday evening announcement. The decree will allow the purchase of pediatric vaccines and pave the way for the country to receive donations. Commuters exit a train station during rush hour in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Wednesday, May 26. The Saudi government has decided to temporarily prohibit travel to the UAE, Ethiopia, Vietnam and Afghanistan due to concerns of the spread of a new mutated strain of the coronavirus, according to an official source in the Ministry of Interior, state-run SPA reported. Travel will not be permitted without obtaining prior permission from authorities. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized another batch of the main ingredient for Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine for use after a safety review, the drug regulator said on Friday. The drug substance was produced at an Emergent BioSolutions Inc. plant in Baltimore. A past mix-up at the Bayview facility, which had been producing two vaccines, triggered a sprawling safety review. The number of travelers passing through U.S. airports topped 2 million for a second straight day, as cities prepare for an influx of visitors over the Fourth of July holiday weekend. In the U.K., the government said it’s considering scrapping all self-isolation measures for those who have been fully vaccinated, potentially risking another clash with the country’s medical profession. In Indonesia, new cases reached the highest levels to date, and the government said it will work with telecommunications providers to track mobility. Tokyo reported the highest number of infections since May, less than three weeks before the start of the Olympic Games. California’s test positivity rate jumped to 1.5%, the highest in about 2 1/2 months, as the state warned of a rise in cases with the spread of the delta variant. Hospitalizations rose 2.9% to 1,405. The state added 1,792 new cases, bringing the total to 3.7 million, while deaths climbed 45 to 63,141. Almost 42 million vaccination doses have been administered. “We know the delta variant is contagious -- and is on the rise,” Governor Gavin Newsom said in a tweet, urging more people to get vaccinated. “We know our hospitalizations are creeping up -- and most of the patients are unvaccinated.” President Joe Biden traveled to Michigan to celebrate U.S. progress in fighting Covid and promote infrastructure spending, part of a slate of Fourth of July weekend events by the administration to signal a return to pre-pandemic life. Slightly less than 67% of the U.S. adult population has at least one dose of a vaccine, short of the president’s goal of getting that number to 70% by Independence Day. Brazil’s Supreme Court Justice Rosa Weber authorized the start of an investigation into President Jair Bolsonaro for possible negligence in the handling of corruption allegations related to the purchase of vaccines from India. Negotiations to buy the Covaxin shot produced by Bharat Biotech International Ltd. turned into a scandal when a government ally said he had personally warned Bolsonaro that a contract signed by the Health Ministry to acquire 20 million doses of the vaccine for 1.6 billion reais ($317 million) was plagued with irregularities. Leading doctors in the U.K. urged the government to keep some pandemic restrictions in place in England, pushing back against Downing Street’s plans to relax measures from July 19. “The idea that on the 19th of July we can return to a pre-Covid world of having no restrictions, we think is not sensible in light of what are spiraling infection rates,” Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association Council said in an interview with the BBC. While the link between cases and hospitalizations has weakened, it hasn’t been broken, he added. The U.K. should avoid putting further strain on the nation’s health care system and instead focus on bringing down the infection rate, particularly with so many cases of long-Covid, Nagpaul said. Latest figures show almost 25,000 people tested positive for Covid over the previous 24 hours in the U.K., underlining how cases have spiked to the highest levels since January. The Transportation Security Administration screened almost 2.2 million travelers at U.S. airports on Friday, the highest number since the start of the pandemic, according to a tweet Saturday from a spokesperson. On Thursday, the TSA said many U.S. airports were already at or exceeding the pre-pandemic numbers of passengers going through security checkpoints, especially near popular summer beach spots. Domestic airline passenger volumes this week were down just 17% from 2019, according to Airlines for America, and an average 89.2% of available aircraft seats were filled, just one percentage point below the same week two years ago. The fast-spreading delta variant is clouding Americans’ hopes for a carefree summer -- and casting a shadow of doubt over plans to get back to business as usual in the fall. The shift in sentiment marks a reversal from the spring, when it looked like the U.S. immunization campaign would turn the tide definitively against the coronavirus. As hospitalizations rise in some states, the Biden administration is sending response teams to less-vaccinated areas to try to combat its spread. Separately, Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious-disease official, said he doesn’t expect another nationwide spike of cases over the variant, given that a “substantial proportion” of the U.S. population has been vaccinated. His full comments are set to air in an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday.

Indonesia’s largest discount carrier has grounded some 25 aircraft because it hasn’t paid lessors that are owed at least $500 million, one of the people said, asking not to be identified discussing sensitive information. The airline is considering returning six of its longer range Boeing Co. 737-900ER jets to lessors in July, the person added. Some of the other 737-900ER jets the carrier owns might be offered in lieu of payment of arrears, according to the person. Lion Air spokesman Danang Prihantoro declined to comment. Like many airlines, Lion Air’s business has been decimated by the coronavirus pandemic. While a bounce-back in air travel has helped carriers in the U.S. and parts of Europe start to recover, in Southeast Asia many international borders remain shut due to fierce Covid outbreaks and low rates of inoculation. Passenger capacity in Indonesia is still around 41% below 2019 levels, data from flight-tracker OAG show. Letting go of some of its planes may help to ease the financial strains on Lion Air. The privately held company has several carriers within its group structure that in total operate a fleet of more than 250 jets. Some of its other brands include Malaysia’s Malindo Air, short-haul carrier Wings Air, Thai Lion Air and Batik Air. Around 80% of the group’s fleet is managed by some 42 operating lessors. Despite Lion Air’s distress, three of its existing lessors -- CDB Aviation, ICBC Leasing and Orix Aviation Systems Ltd. -- have already supplied Airbus SE A320s to the carrier group’s new Indonesian budget airline, Super Air Jet, according to data from Cirium, a sign of just how desperate lessors are to place idle aircraft in the current environment. Some of Lion Air’s lessors are considering taking back their jets from the carrier and remarketing them to other airlines, one of the people said. Delta Air Lines Inc. is interested in around 30 of Lion Air’s used 737s, the online publication The Air Current reported earlier. The U.S. airline declined to comment “on industry rumor or speculation,” it told Bloomberg."

American Airlines Group Inc. has said it will lay off about 19,000 employees on Oct. 1 if Congress doesn’t provide additional financial relief. The airline industry has been hobbled by the coronavirus outbreak, which upended travel plans for millions of Americans and overseas visitors alike.  Meadows said he had spoken with officials from American, as well as from United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. Airline stocks underperformed on Wednesday, with the Standard & Poor’s index of the five biggest U.S. carriers down 1.2% at 12:53 p.m. in New York, against an advance in the broader equity market.  Congress in March provided passenger airlines with more than $50 billion in federal aid, including a $25 billion payroll assistance program. However, after experiencing a roughly 70% drop in passenger traffic compared with a year earlier, the airline industry is asking for more government support. Sara Nelson, president of the largest U.S. flight attendants union, the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, tweeted Wednesday that it’s “good to see WH wants to restart talks.” But she said executive orders won’t preserve a “clean extension” of the payroll support program. Debate has stalled in Congress over a six-month extension of the government’s payroll support for airlines, which would carry the same restrictions on workforce cuts. A new round of assistance would avert involuntary job cuts at American, the company has said. “We have been in touch with the administration and we greatly appreciate their concern for our team members and their support for the aviation industry,” American Airlines said in a statement. “We will continue to work with the administration and our bipartisan supporters in Congress and hope to come to a resolution in a timely fashion.” Frank Benenati, a spokesman for United, said the airline continues to seek an extension of the government payroll program. Delta declined specific comment on any discussions with the White House. The carrier on Monday said it would furlough 1,941 pilots but hasn’t outlined involuntary changes for other employee groups. Southwest Airlines Co. has said that enough employees took early retirement and leave that it will be able to avoid furloughs through the end of this year."

Cathay Director Customer Simon Large, who was responsible for managing brand, corporate and marketing communications, as well as loyalty programs, will leave on July 31, according to a company memo seen by Bloomberg News. Chief Risk Officer Philippe Lacamp’s last day with the airline will be Aug. 31. The memo from Chief Executive Officer Augustus Tang didn’t provide a reason for the resignations. The South China Morning Post reported on the moves earlier Thursday, noting that the departures come ahead of Cathay’s traditional rotation of top executives that happens every three or four years. Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam is the only person being considered as Tang’s successor, the report said, citing a person familiar with the matter.  Tang has headed Cathay during a time of unprecedented challenges, taking over from Rupert Hogg in 2019 as the airline found itself embroiled in Hong Kong’s anti-government protests. The demonstrations, which even spread to the airport and temporarily paralyzed operations there, crimped travel and hurt Cathay’s bottom line. Worse was to come with Covid-19, which has decimated demand for a year-and-a-half. With no domestic market to serve, Cathay’s been hit hard by curbs on international travel and Hong Kong’s strict border and quarantine controls. Its latest traffic figures, for May, showed an improvement from the same month last year, but passenger numbers were still down 99% from May 2019. Cathay’s shares dropped 0.9% Thursday, ending a three-day run of gains. They’ve fallen 33% since the start of last year.

The number of travelers through the Middle East’s tourism hub fell to 25.9 million in 2020, according to a statement. That included 17.8 million passengers during the first quarter of the year, before the pandemic started to impact travel. Since then, restrictions on air travel have battered airlines and airports around the world. “For the first time in the 60-year history of the world’s busiest international airport, the month of April saw commercial flights come to almost an entire halt,” the airport said. Despite the drop in traffic, Dubai International Airport is the largest intercontinental hub in the world, Chief Executive Paul Griffiths said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Monday. “There’s no reason to suggest why we won’t continue to be able to hold that crown going forward.” The number of passengers handled by Dubai International last year surpassed those reported by London’s Heathrow airport, where the number dropped about 73% to 22.1 million in 2020. Frankfurt airport, one of Heathrow’s biggest rivals, posted an 81% drop in passenger numbers last month. While most governments kept borders shut for big chunks of last year, Dubai -- which relies on international tourism for nearly a third of its gross domestic product -- reopened in July. Average customer traffic peaked at 1.3 million in the third and fourth quarters. Opening up is crucial for Dubai International Airport, the busiest airport by international traffic before the pandemic, as it relies heavily on connecting passengers around the globe. “I don’t think that model will change,” Griffiths said. “We just need to get more confidence around the world in travel being possible between countries that have made good progress in protecting their own populations.” Many countries plan to open their borders to people who can show a negative Covid test taken shortly before flying. Some, like Israel, are also proposing vaccination certificates as an enabler for the movement of people between countries. With most of its population soon to be inoculated against Covid-19, Israel is making deals that would let its citizens visit Greece and a handful of other tourist-hungry countries. The United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is a part, has administered 47 doses per 100 people so far.

The stock is down 37% this year. ANA Holdings Inc. forecast its biggest-ever operating loss of 505 billion yen ($4.8 billion) for the fiscal year through March 2021, the latest airline to face an existential threat to its business due to the pandemic. The Japanese carrier unveiled a restructuring plan that calls for: ANA’s self check-in counters at Haneda Airport on Sunday. The outlook issued by ANA calls for a wider full-year loss than the 376 billion yen analysts were projecting on average, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. ANA also forecast 740 billion yen in revenue for the fiscal year through March, compared with analysts’ average prediction for 926 billion yen. The $838 billion global airline industry is set to see revenue slashed by half this year, with carriers cutting jobs and securing funding to ride out the crisis. ANA, Japan’s largest carrier, as well as rival Japan Airlines Co. are suffering from a steep drop in domestic and international passenger traffic. Overseas visitors to Japan fell 99.4% in September from a year earlier as the country largely kept its borders shut. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Teo said the cost management plan, especially the downsizing of the group’s fleet of aircraft, was a positive step. “This is the main driver that will help ANA save 250 billion yen in fiscal 2021 alone based on their guidance,” Teo said. “I am less optimistic about their third brand and proposed platform business, as these could require investment and thus now may not be the best time to do these, although they could be good plans to have for the longer term.” ANA shares fell 3.2% before the results and restructuring plan were released. The stock is down 37% this year. Japan Airlines is set to report results on Friday. ANA is set to receive subordinated loans from five lenders, including Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group and the government-backed Development Bank of Japan. Nikkei reported last month that ANA was considering raising 200 billion yen via a public share offering. Separately, Japan Airlines is seeking to raise about 200 billion to 300 billion yen in subordinated loans, the Kyodo news agency reported earlier this week. Subordinated loans are usually given to debt-heavy or financially weak borrowers to bolster their financial health, because credit rating companies count part of such loans as capital, helping the businesses enhance their credit status. For lenders, they are riskier than straight loans but typically carry higher interest rates. “Both JAL and ANA hold enough liquidity to last at least through this fiscal year,” Teo said. For the latest quarter, ANA reported an operating loss of 122 billion yen, compared with the average estimate for a 115 billion yen loss, on revenue of 170 billion yen. “The results in the first half of the year were very severe,” ANA President Shinya Katanozaka said at a news conference. He vowed to return the airline to profitability in the next fiscal year. Japan, which delayed its plan to hold the Olympics this summer for a year, had prepared for a massive tourism boost, building hotels and redeveloping urban areas. But global passenger traffic won’t return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. The Go To campaign aimed at supporting domestic travel has helped but local demand is far from fully recovered. ANA and Japan Airlines are both forecasting domestic passengers to drop by about 50% this month. Katanozaka said he expects domestic travel to recover to pre-pandemic levels around the end of the year, thanks to the campaign. Katanozaka said he doesn’t expect ANA to require public funding like Japan Airlines, which filed for bankruptcy protection a decade ago and recovered after receiving a government bailout.  A newly branded low-cost carrier in addition to Peach, the budget airline already operated by ANA. 150 billion yen in cost reductions this year and 250 billion yen the following fiscal period, by cutting procurement, office rents and other activities. The temporary transfer of hundreds of employees to other companies; 100 by the end of this year, and 400 by spring. Retiring or halting orders on a total of 33 aircraft, to bring the group’s fleet down to 276 planes. 400 billion yen in subordinated loans to bolster finances."

Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said. Routes to the U.S. might be closed for even longer, only opening widely to overseas airlines once a vaccine has been developed and distributed, Joyce said Thursday. Next year “is going to be another bad year,” Joyce told media on a briefing call after reporting Qantas’s first loss since 2014. “Recovery will take time and it will be choppy.” Expectations for a prolonged recovery reflect Covid-19 resurgences around the world, from Europe and Japan to Australia, Hong Kong and New Zealand. These outbreaks have dashed hopes for controlled flight corridors between some countries that had earlier suppressed the virus. Most of Qantas’s international fleet will be grounded until June 2021. Even in the following 12 months, the airline will probably operate only half its pre-virus offshore schedule, Joyce said. The Sydney-based carrier on Thursday joined loss-making peers such as Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and American Airlines Group Inc. after a near-destruction of their normal business. Qantas doesn’t expect to make money next year, either. Aviation’s worst-ever crisis has wound back the clock for the Qantas boss, who must turn around the airline once again after pulling it back from the brink in 2014. The industry faces a record $100 billion black hole this year and next, according to the International Air Transport Association. Traffic won’t return to pre-crisis levels until 2024, the trade group has said. “The impact of Covid on all airlines is clear,” Joyce said. “It’s devastating and it will be a question of survival for many.” Qantas has repeatedly made deeper cuts as the scale of the crisis became apparent. In recent weeks, the airline raised more than A$1.4 billion ($1 billion) -- its first equity call in a decade -- and it’s also cutting at least 6,000 jobs. Qantas swung to a net loss of A$1.96 billion from a profit of A$840 million a year earlier. The result reflected a slump in passengers, the cost of staff layoffs, and the writedown of the airline’s entire fleet of Airbus A380s, redundant superjumbos that are now grounded for three years. Underlying profit before tax, Qantas’ preferred measure of earnings because it strips out one-time costs, fell 91% to A$124 million. The airline had A$4.5 billion in available liquidity at June 30, including A$1 billion of undrawn facilities, according to the statement. Net debt stood at A$4.7 billion."

Covid Zero Rethink Spurs Asian Travel,"['Kyunghee Park', 'Layan Odeh']",Business,"With some countries in Asia starting to frame Covid-19 as a disease that needs to be managed rather than stamped out, there’s hope 2021 may not be the total travel writeoff feared a few months ago. Speaking in parliament earlier this week, Singapore Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said that while the coronavirus is unlikely to go away any time soon, rising vaccination rates and improving treatments mean it can be thought of “more like influenza.” Similarly, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has promised a “new deal” that would shift the country’s strategy from suppressing the coronavirus to managing it. Thailand, meanwhile, has reopened the tropical island of Phuket to holidaymakers, so long as they’re vaccinated, and on Tuesday, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, mulling the start of a long-anticipated travel bubble with Singapore, indicated both sides should require inoculation as a precondition for participating. And India has increased domestic flight capacity to 65% from 50% as its recent wave of infections ebbs. Such moves are buoying expectations about freer travel toward the end of the year. For now, Asia can only look on in envy as people crowd tourist hotspots in Europe and New York gets back to business. But there’s hope that by Christmas, borders can start to reopen. “We’re seeing an acknowledgment, including in countries where there have been a lot of strict restrictions, that this is a virus that doesn’t fully disappear and instead is one we live with and manage,” said David Mann, chief Asia economist at Mastercard Economics Institute. “Restrictions will be on a loosening trend if you take a six- to 12-month view, especially in places where they’re making progress on vaccinations.” Green shoots are beginning to show in airline seat capacity. After flatlining for more than 12 months, positive signs have started to emerge this month, according to flight-tracking firm OAG. Forward projections for August and September are more robust. Globally, the picture is brightening. Aviation capacity climbed more than 1 percentage point over the past week, and is around 66% of 2019 levels, according to Bloomberg’s weekly flight tracker, which uses OAG data to monitor the pulse of the comeback.  China and Russia have both surpassed 2019 capacity levels, though like in the U.S., the strength comes from their large domestic markets, while overseas travel remains limited. Europe continues to make swift gains after trailing most other regions for the bulk of the pandemic. People can now move relatively freely within the European Union, facilitated by an app that tracks Covid status, as vaccine rollouts gather momentum across the bloc’s 27 member states. The U.K.’s rapid inoculation program could finally start to pay off, after the delta virus thwarted a quicker return to the skies. The government plans to eliminate a self-quarantine requirement on vaccinated arrivals from medium-risk countries. London Heathrow airport reopened a second runway and will resume normal operations in a terminal used by Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. and  Delta Air Lines Inc.   The U.S., one of the drivers of recent global gains, has seen progress stall as airlines continue to battle capacity constraints. Delays and  cancelations have hit  Southwest Airlines Co. and  American Airlines Group Inc., among others, as they try to keep up with rising demand. Flight-tracking firm Cirium is finding limited progress toward restoring connections between key cities within Asia, as well as with major external hubs. Data for June show the number of flights between Singapore and Bangkok have doubled since January, although they’re still well below pre-Covid levels. Another route seeing significant pick-up is Hong Kong-London, with bidirectional travel over a seven-day period averaging 155 flights in June, up from 39 in January. (From July 1, however, Hong Kong banned all flights from the U.K. to curb the spread of the delta variant.) “We believe the pent-up demand in Asia Pacific, exacerbated by extended lockdowns, will follow a similar trajectory in both business and leisure travel as the region cautiously re-opens its borders,” Mastercard’s Mann said. Others aren’t so sure. In May, international traffic in the Asia-Pacific region stood at just 4.3% of the level it was two years earlier, before Covid hit, according to the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. And there have already been setbacks to even modest reopening plans. Thailand’s Prime Minister, Prayuth Chan-Ocha, is isolating at home after he came into close contact with a person who later tested positive for Covid during events held to mark the reopening of Phuket. And the country’s so-called sandbox initiative hasn’t been an instant success -- expectations are low with only 100,000 foreign tourists forecast to arrive in the third quarter, compared with more than 2.5 million a quarter pre-pandemic. China, a key force behind travel in the region, needs to reopen before aviation can recover in any meaningful way, said John Grant, chief analyst with flight tracking firm OAG. “I’m not that optimistic for Asia in its broadest context,” Grant said. “Specific country markets such as Thailand and perhaps to a lesser degree Vietnam that can allow markets such as Europe to re-open will have some benefit, but it will be marginal in the grand scheme of things.” The spread of the Covid variants in Asia has contributed to concerns that airlines could miss out on the travel season for a second year. Malaysia is still in various stages of lockdown and Indonesia recently tightened measures on free movement in Bali and Java. New Zealand also last month temporarily suspended the quarantine-free travel arrangement with Australia after a spike in delta-variant cases. Vaccine hesitancy in some quarters is another issue. In the Philippines, 68% of people are either uncertain or unwilling to take a Covid shot. Singapore, meanwhile, intends to inoculate two-thirds of its 5.7 million-strong population by National Day on Aug. 9 but hasn’t said what relaxations may follow. “Renewed concerns over the appearance of new Covid variants have held back any meaningful reopening of borders,” said Subhas Menon, director general of the AAPA. “This will have a negative impact on airline survival, and additional government support will likely be required.”"

Indonesia’s flag carrier needs cash fast as losses soar past a half-billion dollars and unpaid bills pile up, yet negotiations for government aid move slowly and still may not yield enough to cover the shortfall. A first-half loss of $713 million, announced last week, was just the latest piece of bad news for PT Garuda Indonesia. The airline already missed a payment on an asset-backed security in late July, shortly after extending the repayment of a $500 million sukuk -- an Islamic bond -- by three years because of its cash crunch. And it’s facing a lawsuit in London over aircraft rental fees. One measure shows Garuda at risk of bankruptcy. While passenger traffic improved slightly in June from May after the government eased some travel restrictions, the number of people flown by Garuda was still down 92% from a year earlier, the carrier said Tuesday.  Garuda’s Z-score, a method developed by Edward Altman in the 1960s to predict bankruptcies, was -0.05 at the end of the first quarter, its lowest in at least a decade. The most recent figures on traffic show Garuda’s passenger numbers plunged 98% in May from a year earlier, and by mid-July it had furloughed 825 staff after previously cutting salaries. Indonesia remains in the grip of the pandemic with more than 113,000 confirmed cases. The International Air Transport Association doesn’t expect the airline industry to fully recover before 2024, a bleak outlook that is reflected in Garuda’s share price, which has slumped more than 50% this year. Garuda said in Thursday’s earnings statement that it’s in talks with AerCap Holdings NV to restructure contracts after the Dublin-based firm filed a lawsuit on unpaid aircraft leases. Garuda said it has “negotiated with Aercap several times.” The airline also is in payment talks with Helice Leasing SAS. Garuda and its low-cost unit, Citilink, lease most of their 210 aircraft. Rental costs were the equivalent of about 25% of the company’s revenue last year, the most among nearly 60 carriers tracked by Bloomberg. Setiaputra, who took over Garuda in January, just as the virus was erupting in China, has said there would be a review of the airline’s fleet and network. At the end of 2019, Garuda had $299 million in cash and cash equivalents. That figure shrunk to just $165 million at the end of June. Operating expenses amounted to $1.6 billion in the first six months of this year, with about $700 million of that in cash expenses to suppliers and staff salaries. “Garuda is clearly losing money real fast,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics Pte in Malaysia. “I can’t see how the government can evade bailing them out or not provide meaningful assistance any longer.” Some salvation could come from the government, which in May pledged to extend 8.5 trillion rupiah ($580 million) to the airline as part of a $10 billion package to a dozen state-owned companies. But it hasn’t come yet. Garuda President Director Irfan Setiaputra said he was still in talks with authorities over the weekend, without giving any timing for the injection. Analysts warn it is unlikely to suffice anyway. “It would be difficult for the company to stand on its own with only a 8.5 trillion rupiah bailout,” said Chandra Pasaribu, head of research at Yuanta Securities. “Without growth of its top line, it won’t be enough.”"

The vaccine -- known as Covishield -- isn’t approved by the European Medicines Agency. That has led to some uncertainty about whether recipients will be eligible to travel to the bloc. But the shot is authorized by the World Health Organization, and the European Commission said individual member states can accept those if they want. The production of line for vials of Covishield at Serum Institute’s plant in Pune, India, earlier in January. The U.K. government is also working with the EU on mutual recognition of vaccinations to allow easier travel. “I see no reason at all why the MHRA-approved vaccines should not be recognized as part of the vaccine passports,” Johnson said Friday, referring to the U.K. medicines regulator. “I am very confident that that will not prove to be a problem.” The batches of the Astra vaccine in question were manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. It said this week that it expects European drug regulators will approve Covishield in a few weeks. Johnson made the comments alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has been pushing for the EU to adopt a unified approach on travel from outside the EU. Germany already has a ban on U.K. visitors, classifying the country as a “virus variant area” because of the prevalence in Britain of the highly transmittable delta strain. Merkel said Germany is continuously reviewing its restrictions and that the rules could change once the U.K. variant classification is lowered. The delta variant is causing concern across Europe, with Portugal and Spain imposing new restrictions on U.K. visitors in the past week. On Friday, French Health Minister Olivier Veran said it could lead to a rise in coronavirus cases as soon as the summer.“I sometimes read that there is a risk of a wave of the epidemic linked to this very contagious variant in September, October. I’m not quite sure that we have time to wait,” he said. “I think there’s a possible threat of the epidemic accelerating again in the summer. This is what we’ve seen in the U.K.”"

The air carrier retained Seabury Securities LLC to help raise the exit financing, likely a combination of debt and equity, the company said in a regulatory filing Wednesday. Avianca said it will repay $1.4 billion in bankruptcy loans and have around $1 billion in liquidity when it emerges from the reorganization at some point this year. Avianca was Latin America’s second-largest airline before the Covid-19 pandemic slowed air travel to a trickle last year, leading it to file for Chapter 11 protection in a New York court in May. Latam Airlines Group SA and Mexico’s Grupo Aeromexico SAB also were forced into bankruptcy as the region suffered one of the world’s sharpest drops in flights. In addition to the $1.4 billion in loans it plans to refinance, Avianca raised $900 million from a group of investors including United Airlines, hedge fund Citadel Advisors LLC and Salvadoran air mogul Roberto Kriete. The company is negotiating final terms to convert that tranche into equity as it builds its new capital structure. It’s “still not possible to know” whether the value of existing shares will be diluted, according to the filing. When it emerges, Avianca signaled that its costs will be cut drastically. It said some 300 initiatives will save $500 million annually, helping cut leverage to below three times Ebitda from 5.8 times as of the end of 2019.

Breeze Airways started selling tickets Friday, and the first flights will connect Charleston, South Carolina; Tampa, Florida; and Hartford, Connecticut, according to a company statement. Fares start at $39 one way, and destinations will be added weekly through July 22 until the carrier reaches 39 routes. Source: CeanOrrett/AP Photo Neeleman, who founded JetBlue Airways Corp., is wagering that cheap, nonstop flights between carefully selected midsize cities will enable Breeze to carve out a market niche. But as airlines hammered by the coronavirus pandemic battle over returning travelers, Breeze is likely to face much tougher competition than JetBlue did when it expanded in 2002 as much of the industry was still reeling from the 9/11 terrorist attacks. “Even being wounded coming out of the pandemic, it’s totally diametrically different from a competitive standpoint,” said Dan Akins, an airline consultant at Flightpath Economics. “Then, carriers couldn’t respond. This is not that day. I don’t think they’re going to allow him to start up and start stealing customers from point-to-point service from the menagerie of competitive airlines out there.” Breeze will operate 13 single-class Embraer SA E190 and E195 aircraft initially, and start adding larger Airbus SE A220 planes with a premium cabin in October. It will focus most of its flights from Tampa, Charleston, New Orleans and Norfolk, Virginia. Americans who stayed close to home during the pandemic “have got the money, the pent-up demand,” Neeleman said during a Bloomberg TV interview. “People are anxious to get back to their normal lives, and we’re going to help them do it.” Frontier Airlines, which went public this year, and Spirit Airlines Inc. are two potential foes for Breeze, a unit of Salt Lake City-based Breeze Aviation Group Inc. Another is Allegiant Airlines, a deep discounter that caters to budget vacationers. The Allegiant Travel unit has expanded during the pandemic and now boasts a network stretching across 43 states. Neeleman, whose four previous startups include Canada’s WestJet Airlines and Brazil’s Azul SA, says the Allegiant model works -- and can be replicated. Small markets will expand as low fares and more convenient flights entice consumers to travel more often. “Allegiant has been able to prove if somebody can go to a desirable destination, get there twice as fast and you don’t have to connect through a hub, and pay half as much or a significantly lower price, the market just gets bigger,” Neeleman said in an interview. As much as 95% of Breeze’s flights won’t have nonstop competition, meaning it shouldn’t become the target of larger rivals, Neeleman said. The 16 cities in its early network plans include Pittsburgh; Huntsville, Alabama; and Columbus, Ohio. Like Allegiant, Breeze will seek to operate flights when demand is highest, which means not flying every day of the week from each city. Avelo Airlines, led by Andrew Levy, a co-founder of Allegiant, started flying in April with a similar business model. But Avelo is initially focusing on the western U.S., while Breeze will mostly serve cities in the middle of the country and to the East. “The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the nation’s air service has meant many secondary and tertiary markets have seen a significant reduction in flights,” Neeleman said in the Breeze statement. “There are so many city pairs needing nonstop service around the country, we have a further 100 cities under consideration.” Geared to keeping a lid on costs, Breeze has a unique plan to employ full-time, online college students as young as 18 as part of its flight attendant corps. The company intends to offer low base fares, and a menu of additional products and services designed to pad profits, including a fee starting at $10 to select a seat and $20 for each bag beyond a single carry-on item, whether they’re checked or taken on board, when purchasing the lowest fare. The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, the world’s largest union for such employees, reiterated “serious concerns” over the Breeze student worker program in a letter Wednesday to U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and asked for a review of the airline’s certification to see if it complies with federal work-study rules and equal employment opportunity hiring laws. The union previously raised questions with Utah Valley University over the work-study program established with Breeze. UVU said the partnership didn’t use federal funds. Breeze will rely heavily on technology, with a mobile “super app” that lets travelers book, change or cancel reservations, and add or subtract bags, Neeleman said. The airline, adopting a “technology with kindness” mantra, won’t charge a fee to change or cancel reservations. Rental cars will be available on the app from the start, and Breeze plans to add hotel and event bookings later. Breeze’s technology, especially its app, are “the heart of the airline” Neeleman said. “The holy grail is to be able to change, cancel, all the functionality” for customers to be able to plan all phases of their trips."

Investors dump its securities. But wait: vaccines roll out, economies reopen, and that once-doomed firm looks pretty attractive to traders once again. Sound familiar? Like Hertz, certain Latam shareholders believe the air carrier’s equity is worth something even as it goes through bankruptcy. Their aim is to preserve the value of common stock, which is often, but not always, wiped out when a company restructures in the U.S. The group organized and hired Glenn’s firm, along with financial advisers from Cowen Inc., after the airline’s bankruptcy judge said last month that it was too early to know if Latam is solvent. In addition to his work on Hertz, Glenn steered stockholders of auto parts maker Garrett Motion Inc. toward a recovery earlier this year. When applying a “reasonable multiple” to Latam’s 2019 financial numbers, “there are billions in equity value at play,” Glenn said. “After a long period of uncertainty, everybody sees that recovery.” Representatives for Latam declined to comment. Santiago-based Latam Airlines is the region’s largest air carrier. After Covid-19 travel restrictions crushed revenues, the company filed for bankruptcy in New York last May. Its bonds fell as low as 16 cents cents on the dollar, and the stock tanked as well on the assumption that shares would be worthless during the Chapter 11 process. But Hertz this month proved the exception to the rule: the car rental giant signed a deal to sell itself to an investor group led by Knighthead Capital Management and Certares Management that hands stockholders about $8 a share and fully repays all creditors. Hertz bonds that traded as low as 13 cents on the dollar are now changing hands above par. Hertz “had an auction at the perfect time” to capitalize on vaccine roll-outs and fewer travel restrictions, said Melanie Cyganowski, a former bankruptcy judge now with law firm Otterbourg PC. “The ability of folks to travel for both business and leisure is now something that’s real -- it’s no longer speculative.” Knighthead and Certares, Hertz’s soon-to-be owners which didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment, recently closed a fund that’ll scoop up pandemic-beaten travel companies. And Knighthead has already shown an interest in Latam: it drove a fierce fight over the air carrier’s bankruptcy financing that culminated in the hedge fund getting a piece of the deal. Debt securities tied to Latam have rallied in recent months, with bonds issued by its finance arm trading for more than 90 cents on the dollar. Unsecured claims -- low-ranking debts owed to parties like vendors and aircraft lessors -- are changing hands for more than 70 cents on the dollar from less than 50 cents last month, according to claims market participants. Just like Garrett and Hertz, Latam “had a really bad problem that has now ended and is well positioned for the future,” Glenn said. In those cases, “our firm came in, we protected value and gave it to shareholders. We’re going to do that again.” The tale of Latam Airlines Group SA’s Chapter 11 case is looking eerily similar to that of Hertz Global Holdings Inc. in some respects. Both went bankrupt as the virus raged. Both were in decent financial shape before the pandemic ground travel to a halt. Hertz was alone in sparking a fierce Chapter 11 bidding war, but markets are now painting a much rosier picture for Latam, too. Latam’s bankruptcy “is Hertz five months ago,” and equity holders stand to recover value, said Andrew Glenn, managing partner at Glenn Agre Bergman & Fuentes. His firm represented an ad hoc committee of Hertz shareholders and has now taken up the same role in Latam’s case."

The emergence of a more contagious coronavirus strain and constantly changing restrictions on international travel are weighing on airlines and hotels, even as vaccinations gain pace. The Stoxx 600 Travel and Leisure Index is down 7% since its April peak, making it one of the worst-performing sectors of the past three months. “Although the travel sector looks like it will get some semblance of a season, there isn’t an immediate end to the turbulence in sight,” Susannah Streeter, investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said by email. “A relaxation of the rules by one country, is swiftly followed by a tightening in another, leaving travelers at risk of being left isolated in a hotel overseas with only a TV remote control for company.” While European travel companies are seeing an uptick in demand compared with last year, when countries were still reeling under the initial impact of the pandemic, they’re hardly living up to investor hopes of a summer boom. That’s in stark contrast with the U.S., where a faster-than-expected surge in demand has left airlines scrambling for enough staff. Ryanair Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Michael O’Leary this week said that bookings were recovering strongly between European countries, but were lagging in the U.K. and Ireland, where uncertainty lingered about the duration of restrictions. As of June 20, Europe’s flight activity was still only about half of 2019 levels, and international net sales were 77% lower, according to Bank of America Corp.’s Sky Tracker. “It’s hard to say whether the vaccines will protect the travel sector from sliding into a new depression, but the news flow forces investors to scale back their recovery expectations,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, in an interview. Read More: Global Economy Could Suffer $4 Trillion Loss on Tourism Drop (1) Tightening rules on travel between the U.K. and Europe, a key source of tourism revenue, are a particular concern for investors. Portugal and Spain are among the latest to impose restrictions on U.K. visitors, which may drag on holiday bookings. “The summer season is dwindling away for airlines, and the constant gyrations in regulations over quarantines and testing does little to embolden would-be travelers to plan with confidence,” Josh Mahony, senior market analyst at IG Group, said by email. One bright spot in the industry comes from stocks linked to domestic holidays. Shares of Dometic Group AB, which provides equipment for outdoor breaks, and Trigano SA, which makes mobile homes and caravans, have both surged more than 30% this year. Companies geared toward recreational activities have also thrived. U.K. cycling retailer Halfords Group Plc and Barcelona-based swimming pool-maker Fluidra SA have each rallied more than 60% this year. Hotel chains such as Whitbread Plc, which has about 15% exposure to U.K. coastal towns, may also benefit from the staycation trend, said Streeter from Hargreaves Lansdown. Meanwhile, airlines may struggle even beyond the summer, as they face structural headwinds such as higher environmental costs. According to Citigroup Inc. analysts, the expected capacity levels in 2025 will still be below pre-pandemic levels. They see Ryanair and Wizz Air Holdings Plc as market-share winners, while expecting legacy companies Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Air France-KLM to lose out. In the shorter term, concern around the delta variant has prompted BofA strategists to reduce their overweight position on cyclicals including airlines. “A sharp uptick in cases could lead to further delays, potentially threatening the summer tourism season, which our economists see as a key support factor for euro-area growth over the coming quarter,” they wrote on Friday."

The changes are a setback for Europe’s holiday destinations just as the summer tourism season should be kicking up a gear, and shares of airlines including Ryanair Holdings Plc fell on Monday. The latest decisions add to the patchwork of confusing, and rapidly changing, rules in place for holiday makers. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has suggested the entire EU should coordinate closely and be more cautious about allowing entry to travelers from external countries. The country already has ban on most travel from the U.K., which it describes as a “variant area of concern.” Within the EU itself, Merkel said the reintroduction of border closures among countries should be avoided. During the first wave of the pandemic, closures “were probably unavoidable,” she said on Monday during a German-French parliamentary meeting. “But I agree that something like that shouldn’t repeat itself.” Portugal’s latest decision, which takes effect Monday, imposes a quarantine on unvaccinated arrivals from Britain. Other countries have also recently announced new rules: Irish discount carrier Ryanair and its U.K. rival EasyJet Plc fell 2.9% and 3.8%, respectively, as of 1 p.m. local time on Monday. British Airways owner IAG SA, Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Air France-KLM, the region’s three large flag carriers, also slipped. Spain’s top holiday resort operator, Melia Hotels International SA, fell as much as 6.2%. Trade group Airlines for Europe is also calling for better coordination among EU member states. It said Monday that while the variant is worrying, EU populations most vulnerable to Covid-19, such as the elderly, have now been protected. “With vaccination rates rising across Europe, what we need most now are consistent, established rules for travelers -- not constantly changing national restrictions,” A4E said in a statement. The latest restrictions come days before the start of the EU’s Covid-19 travel certificate program, intended to ease travel within the bloc for those vaccinated. The EU has administered one dose to about half the population, while almost 32% are fully vaccinated. In the U.K., 49% are fully vaccinated. The EU certificate system is set to go live on July 1 as planned and 20 member states are already issuing certificates, a European Commission spokesman told journalists in Brussels. Talks with the U.K. on digital certificates are progressing well, another spokesman said. Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron have previously pushed for a more coordinated response on travel rules. They’ve also been critical about Greece and other southern European tourist destinations which allow in tourists from variant risk areas, or from countries using non-EU approved vaccines. Since May 17, Portugal has been allowing U.K. tourists to enter with a negative Covid-19 test. Earlier this month, the U.K. removed Portugal from its quarantine-free “green” list, reversing an earlier step to lighten travel restrictions. Last week, the U.K. added Spain’s Balearic islands and Malta onto the green travel list. It plans to ease rules further “later in the summer” to allow people who are double-vaccinated to return from countries in its amber list without needing to self-isolate. Spain said on Monday that U.K. tourists coming to Mallorca and Ibiza will have to show proof of full vaccination or a negative PCR test Starting Wednesday, U.K. holidaymakers heading to Malta will also have to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival if they haven’t had their second dose Earlier this month, Italy introduced a five-day quarantine and mandatory testing for travelers from the U.K. On Friday, Germany placed Portugal on its list of variant-concern areas, requiring tourists returning from the Iberian country to quarantine for 14 days Also, Hong Kong said Monday it will ban all passenger flights from Britain starting Thursday, labeling the country “extremely high risk” Delta Variant Threatens to Destroy Another European Summer Hong Kong to Ban Passenger Flights From U.K. From Thursday Germany Seeks to Ban U.K. Travelers From EU: Times"

Several airline trade groups and unions sent a letter Monday to Attorney General Merrick Garland calling for criminal enforcement that goes beyond the increase in civil charges filed so far this year by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA says it has been aggressively acting against people who violate federal regulations. It has sought more than $300,000 in fines in more than 20 cases. “The FAA’s zero tolerance policy remains fully in place, and we will continue to work with local law enforcement and the DOJ to make it clear that unsafe and unruly behavior simply does not fly,” the agency said in an emailed statement. There have been almost 3,000 reports of unruly passengers on flights this year, a dramatic increase over previous years, according to the FAA. The agency has attempted to fine dozens of people, many of whom refused to wear masks. Federal law makes it a crime to assault or intimidate airline pilots or flight attendants, though violations have traditionally been handled with non-criminal civil prosecutions by the FAA. “Making these prosecutions public will put a spotlight on the serious consequences when breaking the law and will act as an effective deterrent against future onboard disruptions,” the groups said. The organizations behind the letter include Airlines for America, a trade group for large carriers, the largest U.S. flight-attendant unions and groups representing other airlines. A4A’s president Nicholas Calio asked FAA Administrator Steve Dickson in a separate letter on Monday to coordinate with the Justice Department and to refer cases for criminal charges where appropriate. “The federal government should send a strong and consistent message through criminal enforcement that compliance with federal law and upholding aviation safety are of paramount importance,” the groups said in the letter. The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on the letters."

A transaction may be announced as soon as this week, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing the matter. The deal is expected to have a value of more than $30 billion, said the Wall Street Journal, which reported the talks earlier. Shares of both companies gained. Between them, GE Capital Aviation Services, or Gecas, and AerCap have almost 3,000 aircraft owned, managed or on order. A combination would speed GE Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp’s push to streamline the U.S. industrial icon after an epic corporate meltdown. While terms of the potential agreement with AerCap are unclear, a sale of Gecas could garner GE about $25 billion, Bloomberg Intelligence said in a report in 2019. Last year, GE completed the sale of its bio-pharmaceutical business to Culp’s former employer, Danaher Corp., for $21.4 billion. Read: General Electric Has One Way to Fly Out of Trouble: Gadfly A deal would also mark a significant consolidation in the leasing sector at a time of “extreme uncertainty” for aviation, said John Strickland, who runs London-based airline advisory firm JLS Consulting. The combined company would have greater negotiating clout with manufacturers like Boeing Co. and Airbus SE, while being able to focus on the strongest airline customers during the recovery, when many will remain reliant on lessors for financing flexibility. GE declined to comment, and AerCap representatives couldn’t immediately be reached for comment outside regular business hours on Sunday. AerCap surged 11% to $56.57 at 9:47 a.m. in New York after advancing as much as 15% for the biggest intraday gain in about four months. The company, based in Dublin and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, had a market value of $6.6 billion at the end of last week. GE climbed 2.3% to $13.92, adding to a 26% increase for the year through Friday. The pandemic has hammered the aviation industry and pushed airlines around the world to cancel new jetliner orders, push back delivery dates and defer lease payments. As middlemen, aircraft leasing firms have suffered too, while also playing a critical financing role to keep deliveries flowing, often with sale-leaseback deals that hand cash to airlines with jet handovers. But a combination of two major players would be likely to receive scrutiny from antitrust authorities, other regulators and business partners, given the weight of the two companies in the sector. For GE, a tie-up would extend a shift away from the company’s longtime business model of using its powerful leasing platform to generate sales of commercial aircraft powered by the company’s jet engines. GE’s finance arm has been significantly pared back since it nearly crippled the company during the 2008 financial crisis. “The old world where you needed a leasing a company to support your manufacturing is gone,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson said. “For AerCap, this could be something that’s too good to refuse.” Culp has been shedding assets in recent years as part of his broader turnaround effort at GE after a collapse that wiped out a total of more than $200 billion in market value during 2017 and 2018. Under his leadership, the Gecas portfolio has been left in something akin to “caretaker status,” Ferguson said. In 2019, GE agreed to sell an aircraft-financing business for $3.6 billion to Apollo Global Management and Athene Holding Ltd. as the ailing manufacturer slimmed down its once-vast lending arm. The same year, Culp sped up a plan to sell off GE’s stake in oilfield-services provider Baker Hughes in a push to refocus GE’s once-sprawling industrial businesses. The asset sales have raised critical cash that GE has used to repay its bloated debt load, one of Culp’s top priorities in his turnaround drive. The company has cut some $30 billion in debt since 2019, including $16 billion last year. GE had total borrowings of about $75 billion at the end of 2020. A deal with Gecas would likely elevate the profile of Aengus “Gus” Kelly, AerCap’s hard-charging CEO. He emerged on the global stage in 2014 with AerCap’s $7.6 billion acquisition of leasing pioneer ILFC from American International Group. By pooling assets, the new entity may be able to access the capital markets more cheaply than Gecas could acting under GE’s corporate umbrella, Ferguson said. Gecas had about $35.9 billion in assets at the end of last year, with about 1,650 aircraft owned, serviced or on order. AerCap, with assets of $42 billion, owned 939 aircraft and managed 105, according to a regulatory filing. It also had 286 planes on order, including jet models such as the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max. Gecas CEO Greg Conlon said at the Airline Economics conference in January that the company was looking at mergers and acquisitions and portfolio purchases, and that he saw opportunities in cargo aircraft and engine leasing. Kelly spoke at the same conference and said fewer airline customers were seeking deferrals."

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced plans to end social distancing and capacity limits at venues in England in two weeks, saying people must learn to live with coronavirus. U.S. President Joe Biden celebrated Independence Day by hailing what he called a “heroic” vaccination campaign. Brazil’s president saw his popularity sink amid a vaccine scandal. The Duchess of Cambridge will self-isolate after coming into contact with a case. Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha will also isolate at home for a week. Luxembourg’s premier remains hospitalized for a second day after testing positive over a week ago, just days after attending a summit with European Union counterparts. Australia has administered 8.2 million vaccines doses, according to data collected by Bloomberg News and Johns Hopkins University. The average rate is estimated at 125,007 doses a day. At this pace, it will take a projected 7 months to cover 75% of the population with a two-dose vaccine. Immunizations there started about 19 weeks ago. Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro’s approval rating has fallen to 34%, the lowest since he assumed office, after being accused of turning a blind eye to an alleged kickback scheme in the purchase of vaccines. An MDA poll published Monday showed his popularity falling from 44% in February. Myanmar reported 2,969 new infections Monday, the largest single-day increase in cases since it first detected the coronavirus in March 2020, according to the country’s Ministry of Health and Sports. The rate of positive tests was 26.9%, also a record, and there were 42 new deaths. Pfizer’s vaccine appears to be less effective in halting the spread of the delta strain, though it remains highly effective at preventing severe illness, according to data from Israel’s government. The shot protected 64% of people against Covid between June 6 and early July, down from 94% between May 2 and June 5, the Ynet news website reported, citing Health Ministry numbers. At the same time, the vaccine’s efficacy at keeping people who get infected out of the hospital in that period slipped only slightly, to 93% from 98%. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced plans to end social distancing and capacity limits at venues in England from July 19, saying that people must learn to live with coronavirus. Face masks will be made voluntary in all settings and the government will no longer instruct people to work from home, in a decisive shift from legal requirements to personal responsibility. All remaining businesses will be allowed to open, including nightclubs, and none will be required to demand any proof of vaccination or testing before entry. The final decision will be still need to be confirmed on July 12. Mayors from the biggest English cities up and down the country urged U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson to stop people on public transport from traveling without face masks. Johnson is expected to confirm on Monday that face coverings will no longer be required in many situations after July 19. “Many people are still anxious about traveling on public transport and we need to get people back to normal again; normal means taking public transport, which we know they haven’t been,” said Dan Norris, the Labour Mayor for the West of England, in an interview. Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel will remain hospitalized for a second day after testing positive over a week ago, just days after attending a summit with European Union counterparts. Bettel’s condition “is serious, but stable,” his government said. In Namibia, the delta variant was detected in 17 out of 28 samples analyzed, Health Minister Kalumbi Shangula told reporters on Monday in the capital, Windhoek. The southwest African nation with a population of about 2.5 million recorded 4,795 cases per million people over the last week, the highest rate globally for that period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Mauritius, a tourism-reliant Indian Ocean island nation, is set to fully inoculate 70% of its population by the end of September, before the second phase of reopening its borders to vaccinated tourists, according to Finance Minister Renganaden Padayachy. The target is within reach after the country received a second consignment of 500,000 SinoPharm vaccines on Sunday. The Duchess of Cambridge is self-isolating for 10 days after coming into contact with a person who had Covid-19, The Times of London reported, citing Kensington Palace. She hasn’t experienced any symptoms. Scotland is recording the highest rates of coronavirus cases in Europe a little over a month before the government plans to lift most restrictions on society and the economy. The regions covering the cities of Dundee and Edinburgh were top of the World Health Organization’s latest heat map, the BBC reported, as the delta variant rips through the country. Scotland last week reported daily infections exceeding 4,000 for the first time since the start of the pandemic. It’s counting on vaccinations to break the link between infection and serious illness. So far, the data appears to back up that approach, with hospitalizations rising at a much slower rate than new cases. A government poster urging caution in Glasgow, Scotland. Bangladesh reported daily records of 9,964 new virus cases and 164 deaths on Monday. The capital city of Dhaka accounted for almost half the daily caseload, while Khulna, a southwestern administrative division, logged 55 fatalities in signs of transmission in rural areas. About 50% of infections come from villages, the Directorate General of Health Services said on Monday. The agency had previously lowered the minimum age for vaccines to 35 years from 40 years, as the South Asian nation resumes mass inoculations. Norway decided to postpone the introduction of stage four in its reopening plan to at least the end of July because of the risks posed by the delta variant, Prime Minister Erna Solberg said at a press conference in Oslo. The government will however ease some restrictions, including a limit on the number of participants at outdoor events and some entry rules. Iran had the highest number of new daily coronavirus cases since May 12, with 16,025 infections and 157 deaths reported overnight. The Health Ministry has recorded over 3.2 million infections and 84,000 deaths since the onset of the pandemic, with around 2.4% of the country’s population having received both vaccine doses so far. World leaders need to take personal responsibility for leading efforts to prevent a future global pandemic and manage the current Covid-19 crisis, said The Elders, a non-governmental organization made up of former state leaders and public figures. The Elders appealed to heads of state to implement the recommendations of the Independent Panel on Pandemic Preparedness and Response by agreeing to a Political Declaration at a special summit held during the United Nations General Assembly, in September. They should personally commit to establishing a Global Health Threats Council, which could coordinate international preparedness efforts and avoid the mistakes made during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Earlier, Reuters reported that talks were underway, citing an interview with Lee Kang-ho, the director general for the global vaccine hub committee under South Korea’s health ministry. The Health Ministry said in a statement that any vaccine deal is an issue pending negotiation between companies, and that Lee said in the interview that South Korea has capacity to produce more than 1 billion doses of mRNA shots.

Israel has recorded a steep drop in the efficacy rate of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in preventing coronavirus infections, due to the spread of the delta variant and the easing of government restrictions, Ynet news website reported, citing Health Ministry data. At the same time, the decline in protection against serious cases and hospitalization is considerably milder, the website said. The figures show that between May 2 and June 5, the vaccine had a 94.3% efficacy rate. From June 6, five days after the government canceled coronavirus restrictions, until early July, the rate plunged to 64%. A similar decline was recorded in protection against coronavirus symptoms, the report said. Mortality “significantly” increased in the recent Covid-19 wave in India, according to a new study, pointing to the possibility that the delta variant may also be more deadly. The higher incidence of deaths was seen in all age groups except those below 20 years of age, said a study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research by researchers led by Gunjan Kumar. Tokyo Olympic organizers have postponed the announcement of ticket lottery results by four days, awaiting a decision by the government on coronavirus measures that could affect the number of spectators allowed at venues. The government is expected to decide this week whether to extend the current strong virus measures beyond July 11, when they are due to expire. Sanofi’s Covid-19 vaccine will be available in December, Olivier Bogillot, the drugmaker’s French chief, said in an interview with France Inter on Monday. Bogillot said there’s room for another vaccine as so many people still need to get the jabs. Indonesia will start importing oxygen cylinders to meet surging demand from Covid-19 patients as the country battles an exponential rise in infections that overwhelms its hospitals. The government is urging those with mild symptoms to be treated at home because hospitals are full, Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said in a media briefing on Monday. Vietnam’s Prime Minster Pham Minh Chinh ordered Ho Chi Minh City and adjacent provinces to take more effective actions to slow infections, warning the nation’s commercial hub could see virus infections grow to uncontrollable levels. Ho Chi Minh City, which extended social distancing measures indefinitely June 29, is now the nation’s worst virus-hit region with 6,206 local infections as of Monday morning since the latest outbreak began in late April. Sydney’s outbreak of the delta-variant of the coronavirus is raising concern Australia’s most-populous city may need to extend its two-week lockdown beyond Friday. The city of about 6 million people recorded 35 new cases in the community on Monday, raising the total infections since mid-June to 312.

The U.S. State Department issued its “do not travel” statement after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention boosted its travel alert to “Very High,” citing a surge in cases that puts even fully vaccinated travelers at risk for contracting and spreading coronavirus variants. Any travelers to the U.K. should wear a mask and stay at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) from other people, the CDC said. The warning comes amid a jump in cases that is already undermining the U.K.’s so-called “Freedom Day,” a lifting of pandemic-related restrictions intended to herald the full reopening of an economy battered by its deepest recession in 300 years. The U.K. added more than 54,000 new cases Saturday, and over 47,600 on Sunday, more than Indonesia, the current pandemic epicenter, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The inauspicious reopening coincided with a worldwide slump in stocks as investors fled toward safety and away from airlines, cruise companies and other industries that count on Covid-19 being contained enough to ensure a smooth economic reopening. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is taking heat for his handling of the pandemic and Labour leaders heaped scorn on his initial attempts to bypass isolation guidelines after his own Covid exposure. Even amid the surge, the U.K. government went ahead Monday with easing most of the remaining Covid-related restrictions, including reopening nightclubs. Quarantines for fully vaccinated travelers from many European vacation destinations were also dropped, though the U.K. maintained self-isolation rules for travelers returning from France. For airlines, concerns over the spread of the delta variant have outweighed the boost from reopening for now. The Bloomberg EMEA Airlines Index slid 5.8% to its lowest point since February. A Standard & Poor’s Index of the five largest U.S. airlines tumbled 3.8% in New York, also to the lowest in more than five months. It wasn’t immediately clear how the CDC decision might affect deliberations within the Biden administration to drop travel restrictions to much of Europe, the U.K. and Ireland. The president signaled progress toward lifting the ban on July 16 after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. “The scientific evidence, including independent studies from Mayo, Harvard and the Defense Department, all point to the safety of air travel with proper safeguards in place,” said Tori Emerson Barnes, a vice president of the U.S. Travel Association. She called for a timeline for the reopening of international travel, “particularly with countries with similar vaccination rates to the U.S. -- starting with a U.K.-U.S. air corridor -- given the durability of the vaccines and the need to get international travel safely restarted.” U.S. airlines have been lobbying for months for an end to the ban, which affects 26 European countries. It initially was implemented by then-President Trump and later extended by Biden. Trans-Atlantic routes comprise by far the biggest market for premium long-haul travel and opening a corridor between the two countries would give carriers a needed financial boost as they emerge from coronavirus-related constraints. Other transportation stocks also were affected, including cruise operator Carnival Corp., which tumbled 5.7% to $19.72 in New York -- its sixth day of declines in the longest streak since February 2020. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. fell 5.5% to $21.87. Three more Carnival ships will restart guest operations in September and another four in October, bringing the total to 15, the company said Monday. It plans to bring back the entire fleet by the end of 2021."

Giving details about the program on Monday, Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said 10 “mega prizes” would give families of four free travel with Qantas and its low-cost unit Jetstar for 12 months. Previously announced rewards for fully vaccinated passengers include air miles, flight vouchers and loyalty program status credits. After suppressing the virus, Australia is now struggling to overcome vaccine hesitancy. Only about 4.2 million people in the nation of 26 million have received their first shot, and the state of Victoria is in the middle of a week-long lockdown to rein in a growing cluster of cases. Joyce called on other Australian companies to offer their own incentives to customers who’ve had coronavirus jabs. “We have a vested interest in this,” Joyce said in a television interview with Channel 9 on Monday. Companies worldwide with the most to gain from a return to normal economic activity are dangling the biggest rewards for vaccinations. United Airlines Holdings Inc. is also offering frequent fliers the chance to win free flights. Governments have joined in: New York is running a free lottery for vaccinated people with a top prize of $5 million, one of several U.S. states offering jackpot winnings as an incentive. New Jersey and others have offered free beer. In Hong Kong, vaccinated residents stand to win a $1.4 million apartment."

Europe’s biggest airline aims to pare annual expenses by 3.5 billion euros ($4.2 billion) to help it achieve adjusted earnings before interest and tax equal to at least 8% of sales by 2024, according to a statement. That’s a level it achieved just once in the five years preceding the pandemic. The new targets come as Lufthansa appoints banks to refinance state bailouts. More than half of the savings will be from staff cuts that have been announced but not yet fully implemented, with 10,000 jobs yet to go in Germany alone. The airline also plans to eliminate as much as 30% of office space, renegotiate supplier contracts and trim external consulting and marketing budgets. The plan should be taken with “an ounce of caution given the high dependency on labor-cost reduction,” said Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein, pointing to the challenge of getting labor unions to agree to cuts. Clarity will come only next year with union negotiations and possible forced dismissals, he said. Lufthansa shares traded 1.1% lower as of 11:37 a.m. in Frankfurt and are down 2.3% for the year. The airline confirmed that Germany’s WSF stabilization fund, its biggest shareholder, may participate in a planned capital raise that will help refinance a 9 billion-euro state bailout. People familiar with the matter said last month that it’s aiming to garner about 3 billion euros via a rights issue. WSF is considering selling some of its subscription rights and using proceeds to purchase new shares, according to the statement late Monday, a move that would free taxpayers from committing more cash while shrinking the government’s holding, albeit to a lesser degree than if it didn’t participate. Lufthansa appointed Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to help with the capital raising. Speaking on an analyst and investor call following the announcements, Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr said Lufthansa would look to adapt to developments in the post-crisis aviation market. Such moves could involve shifting planes to long-haul budget brand Eurowings Discovery, established to tap any rapid recovery in leisure travel. Lufthansa could also enter the short-haul cargo market with dedicated freighter aircraft, Spohr said. The carrier has used Boeing Co. 777F aircraft to ply such routes as pandemic groundings reduce belly capacity in passenger jets, something that could become a regular feature if cargo yields remain high. Spohr also gave further details on how he expects summer travel to proceed. Lufthansa now sees passenger numbers at 30% of pre-crisis levels in June, rising to 45% in July and 55% in August, in line with its previous forecast for a 40% figure for full-year 2021.

The VSS Unity space plane detached from a carrier aircraft high over New Mexico and rocketed to a speed of Mach 3 on its way to an altitude of about 282,000 feet, or more than 53 miles (86 kilometers) above the Earth. The Unity then glided back through sunny skies and landed at about 9:38 a.m. local time on Sunday -- approximately an hour after taking off. Virgin Galactic’s VSS Unity, with billionaire Richard Branson on board, after detaching from VMS Eve on July 11. “Welcome to the dawn of a new space age,” Branson told guests at the Spaceport America complex near the town of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. He later said to reporters, “I was once a kid with a dream looking up to the stars and now I’m an adult in a spaceship looking back to our beautiful Earth.” The suborbital journey kicks off a landmark month for the future of space tourism, with Branson looking to demonstrate Virgin Galactic’s capabilities nine days before Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos plans to fly on a rocket made by Blue Origin, his space venture. Both companies envision businesses catering to wealthy tourists willing to pay top dollar for a short period of weightlessness and an unforgettable view of the Earth and heavens. Virgin Galactic’s test flight demonstrated that such trips -- once the stuff of science fiction -- are becoming increasingly realistic. The shares gained 10% in premarket U.S. trading, after doubling in price this year. While mostly accessible only to a tiny number of super-wealthy customers, the trips would add a new dimension to a burgeoning industry of private-sector space companies with plans for voyages to the International Space Station and new human outposts. Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. is pushing ahead with even grander designs. The company is already carrying astronauts to the space station for the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration and planning its own tourism flights. SpaceX is also developing a rocket designed to reach the moon and Mars, rapidly expanding its satellite-launch business and building a network of Starlink satellites to provide internet service around the world. WATCH: Branson spoke to Bloomberg’s Ed Ludlow after touching back down on Earth. (Source: Bloomberg) Branson and his fellow crew members experienced a few minutes of weightlessness as the Unity reached its peak altitude. Virgin Galactic operations engineer Colin Bennett said he was so busy with assigned cabin work at the start of the space journey that fellow passenger and company executive Beth Moses had to remind him to look out the window. “So I looked out the window and the view is just stunning,” he said. “It’s very Zen; it’s very kind of peaceful up there as well.” Virgin Galactic’s VSS Unity space plane separates from the carrier as the vehicle rockets to an altitude of about 282,000 feet, or more than 53 miles (86 kilometers) above the Earth on Sunday.

Source: Virgin Galactic The space plane held up well in the test mission and “looks pristine,” said Mike Moses, Virgin Galactic’s president of space missions and safety and who had the distinction of having both his boss and wife aboard the spacecraft. He acknowledged transmission problems with the livestream, which cut in and out as people all over the world watched. “We think we have some antenna blockage we can work on, but that’s the only actual real issue we’re tracking right now on the ship,” he said. “We’ll take our time and do all the detailed inspections and then we’ll figure out when we’re ready to go again.” The mission was the spacecraft’s 22nd test flight and first with a large crew. Virgin Galactic dubbed the flight “Unity 22,” and it was the first of two tests the company is planning this summer before an astronaut-training mission with Italian Air Force personnel later this year. Branson’s job on the trip was to evaluate the customer experience during the flight and in the various preparatory events Virgin Galactic plans around its launches.

The company said the Unity performed well after more than two months of work to minimize electromagnetic interference that had delayed a planned February 2021 test. In a flight in December 2020, the rocket motor failed to ignite and the spacecraft glided back to the spaceport. WATCH: Virgin Galactic CEO Michael Colglazier spoke to Bloomberg’s Ed Ludlow following the space flight. (Source: Bloomberg) The test in May was the company’s first successful powered flight since February 2019. Following the test that took place more than two years ago, flight engineers discovered hull damage on the spacecraft from air pressure that had built up after ventilating holes were accidentally covered, according to “Test Gods,” a book published this year by New Yorker writer Nicholas Schmidle. The VSS Unity glides during a 2018 test flight. Virgin Galactic plans to begin working down its backlog of around 600 confirmed customers in early 2022. Virgin Galactic has said it will resume ticket sales after the summer’s test flights, with executives saying that fares will be higher than the prior price of $250,000 a seat. The company’s shares have doubled this year through Friday, lifting the company’s value to almost $12 billion. Branson, who founded Virgin Galactic in 2004, said another reward was seeing the Earth from space. ”I’m never going to be able to do it justice,” he said. “It’s indescribably beautiful.” Billionaire Richard Branson, left, celebrates with champagne and other crew members after flying into space aboard Virgin Galactic’s VSS Unity on July 11.

But needing travelers back and wanting them back are different things. Waves crash at normally crowded Sunset Beach Park on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii. The tennis courts of  Mauna Kea Beach Resort, set just above the coastline on the island of Hawaii, are busy once again, having settled into a new pandemic paradigm. Tennis pro Wayne Barnes uses a pair of tongs to deliver red licorice strips, treats for the pint-size players who’ve completed their 30-minute lesson. He tries to keep the kids from crowding closely, then looks over his shoulder toward a group of teens arriving for the next session. “Keep your masks on until you’re on the court,” he calls out, then makes sure each has an orange bracelet indicating that they passed a temperature check. Over the winter holidays, Barnes’s tennis clinics were the busiest they’d been since the novel coronavirus went global. Then again, anything would be an uptick from basically zero. When Covid-19 struck, the Aloha State instituted  one of the country’s strictest lockdowns, blocking international travel and effectively halting domestic tourism by requiring incoming passengers to quarantine for 14 days. Hotels closed, condos shuttered, and the verdant archipelago—where at least a quarter of all jobs are  connected to the tourism industry—saw its unemployment rate rise from less than 4%, the lowest in the country, to 15%, one of the highest. Hawaii’s cautious reopening began in October, but much of the world is just not ready for leisure travel: Almost 1 million visitors descended on the islands in December 2019; in December 2020 the number was less than 250,000. For the most part, residents have been serious about the virus. Some of that is because of island life, a sense that everyone is in it together, and the knowledge that, if the situation got truly severe, there are no neighboring states to rely on when you’re 2,400 miles out to sea. History has also been a factor. During the 19th century an estimated 90% of Hawaii’s native population was killed by diseases brought to the islands by outsiders. The state knows—and fears—pandemics, and its aggressive countermeasures, while hardly perfect, have worked so far. As of Feb. 17, Hawaii has the lowest rate of  Covid cases of any state (1,896 per 100,000) and the lowest seven-day average of new cases (48). The economic cost of these preventative measures, however, has been devastating. In 2019, 10.4 million visitors to Hawaii delivered more than $2 billion in state tax revenue. Fewer than 2 million people visited in 2020, and most of those were during the first two months of the year. The state is now predicting a $1.4 billion shortfall in each of the next four years, and budget slashing has already begun. But needing travelers back and wanting them back are different things. It’s been a tense topic on the islands for decades. The shift from “a tourism economy to a tourism society,” as Noel Kent, author of Hawaii: Islands Under the Influence, recently put it, has been pushing the limits of livability in some areas. Families need three, even four jobs to make ends meet because of the state’s cost of living—the highest in the nation, according to research from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center. On the North Shore of Oahu, some residents don’t leave their homes on weekends because of the traffic. Strategic planners on Kauai are talking about a “tipping point” in terms of visitors’ impact. Resident sentiment is conflicted. According to a 2018 study by the Hawaii Tourism Authority, 59% of people surveyed said the benefits of tourism outweigh the costs. And yet, two-thirds of those same respondents said they think their home island is “being run for tourists at the expense of local people.” This last year gave a glimpse of what life could be like without tourists, and for those who didn’t lose their jobs during the pandemic—or did but found sufficient financial stability through state and federal unemployment programs—the past 12 months in Hawaii have been magical. At normally bustling Hapuna Beach State Park on the west coast of Hawaii Island, for instance, you could swim or stroll without seeing more than a few others. Choked trails such as the route to the summit of famed Diamond Head on Oahu thinned out. At Hanauma Bay, a popular snorkel spot, researchers found that the park’s closure led to an increase in marine life and improved the health of the lagoon’s ecosystem. The man in charge of finding the middle ground between reclaiming the islands for residents and bringing back tourists is John De Fries, who was named president and chief executive officer of the Hawaii Tourism Authority in September. He says that in a given week, he’ll hear from people who think the state should limit visitors to 6 million a year, and others who think Hawaii can handle 12 million or even 15 million a year. Committing to a specific number probably doesn’t make sense; tourism’s effects vary widely depending on behavior, management, and enforcement. Paul Brewbaker, an economics consultant who closely tracks tourism data, is critical of both camps, but especially the antitourism crowd. He says their approach is more emotional, less empirical, and preempts “serious discussion of economic policy interventions because, presumptively, less”—as in fewer tourists—“is more.” De Fries, likewise, isn’t thinking only in terms of numbers. His strategy is focused on the popularity of so-called voluntourism. As the first native Hawaiian tapped to run the tourism authority, De Fries is sensitive about the idea of responsibility to future generations. He grew up not far from Waikiki, where he fished and learned the old traditions with family, while also watching that corner of Oahu grow into the hotel, shopping, and dining playground that it is today. To strike a healthier balance between tourism and residents, he uses the word malama, which is Hawaiian for protect or nurture. “It is the sister cultural value to aloha,” he says. Bringing malama into practice begins by linking hotels and other business partners with educational and service organizations to develop programs for tourists. Outrigger Hotels & Resorts, for example, offers guests a third night free if they sign up for a two-hour volunteer program at the Kualoa Ranch Private Nature Reserve. Not far from where Barnes teaches tennis at Mauna Kea Beach Resort, guests can learn about beekeeping and how honey from one of the eight apiaries on the property is used in Hawaiian cuisine. Other programs include reforestation and reef restoration. These offerings may not matter to first-time visitors intent on lounging on the beach by day and drinking mai tais at night. But De Fries hopes that travelers returning to the islands for their third, fourth, or fifth time—more than 65% of those who came to Hawaii before Covid were repeat visitors—will want to get involved in cultural or environmental programs. This is especially true for affinity groups such as birders, hula enthusiasts, and volcanology geeks. It’s enchanting to think that someday travel, as both idea and activity, could mean nurturing the places we visit. The economist Brewbaker is skeptical. “I have no idea what malama is,” he says. “It’s not really worth it for me to figure it out because the pandemic is such an overwhelming obstacle right now to restoring travel and tourism.” There’s no harm in going for big, long-term ideas, he adds. In the short term, though, what will determine whether travelers return to Hawaii has nothing to do with the tourism authority and everything to do with the virus and perceived safety. In many ways, the pandemic has already catalyzed a new way of thinking about others and the ripple effects of individual decisions. Masks, social distancing, hand-washing—“these are all ways to malama,” De Fries says. The key now is to fuse malama with management. Stephanie Donoho, administrative director of the Kohala Coast Resort Association, which represents several luxury hotels on the west coast of Hawaii Island, recalls a recent trip to Peru. Hiking the Inca Trail, another famous and fragile tourism hot spot, she noticed the various fees required, the careful management of visitor traffic, and the requirements to hire local guides. “The whole thing was about giving back,” she says. Some wildly popular destinations such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, and Venice are taking steps to limit the number of tourists and mitigate visitor effects on culture, natural resources, and the everyday lives of their residents. Hawaii could end up doing the same. But what the state should not do, De Fries says, is suddenly restrict the number of visitors. “To drop to 6 million and hope they’ll spend more is a giant leap of faith,” he says. Instead he wants to attract those who are “more aware, more sensitive,” he says. “We need them to malama us! This culture of reciprocity is embedded in Hawaiian culture.” If tourism simply returns to normal without consideration for the emotional and economic well-being of the people who live here, he says, “there will be no aloha.” More than half of Hawaii’s hotel rooms will remain empty in 2021, according to data from industry groups. But these new and notable hotels are waiting for you Mauna LaniAuberge’s $200 million reimagining of the iconic resort officially opened on the Big Island in November. Its focus on wide-open outdoor experiences goes beyond the classic surf lesson. Book one-on-one workshops to learn how to weave coconut fronds, blow conch shells, and strum a ukulele. Or study the ancient storytelling art of mo‘olelo—all with the property’s indigenous culture ambassador. Social distancing is also easy at night, thanks to toes-in-the-sand dining options and private outdoor space for every room. Sensei Lana‘iGolf, horseback riding, mindfulness sessions, nutrition consultations, and even semiprivate air travel are included in the $650-plus nightly rate at this serene, adults-only Four Seasons resort on one of Hawaii’s tiniest inhabited islands. The holistic approach to wellness seems purpose-built for pandemic times: Rooms with outdoor showers, takeaway service from the Nobu restaurant, and open-air spa treatments make it easy to follow Covid guidelines without sacrificing an ounce of luxury. Halepuna WaikikiLast year, every major travel magazine called this Champalimaud-designed urban oasis—the little sibling of the famous Halekulani resort—the best hotel in Hawaii, even though it had opened only a few months before the pandemic took hold. When it comes back in April, the Honolulu property will defend that reputation by blocking off alternating rooms to prevent crowding, keeping them unoccupied for 24 hours between guests, and offering facials and massages in the comfort of your own suite. 1 Hotel Hanalei BayPlanning a trip further off in the future? By this time next year, the beloved Princeville resort will be reborn on Kauai island under the eco-luxury 1 Hotels brand. Its most famous perk—the knockout sunset views overlooking Hanalei Bay and the Na Pali coast—will remain unchanged. But newcomers will find beefed-up amenities like a sprawling spa and five restaurants supplied by an on-site garden, in addition to new spaces where guests can learn about how social justice and environmentalism intersect."

The drugmaker expects regulatory approval for its shot by June. The U.S. State Department is changing the way it issues travel advisories to reflect the prevalence of the coronavirus in countries around the world, in a move it said will result in about 80% of the world’s nations being considered no-go zones. Travel advisories will be updated to better reflect health notices issued by the Centers for Disease Control and will also take into account metrics including the prevalence of testing and domestic travel restrictions, the Department said in a statement. The advisories, which rank countries on a scale of 1 to 4, aren’t binding. “This update will result in a significant increase in the number of countries at Level 4: Do Not Travel, to approximately 80% of countries worldwide,” the department said. The State Department raised the global travel advisory to Level 4 on March 19, 2020 an unprecedented move as the U.S. and the rest of the world sought to bring the virus under control. That blanket warning was lifted last August, though many nations continue to restrict travel from the U.S. Deliveries of Pfizer Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine to South Africa were delayed by demands from the U.S. drugmaker that it determine the guarantees needed to indemnify the company from any negative effects from the shots. The condition was resisted by the government and Pfizer eventually backed down, agreeing to supply 30 million doses of the vaccine co-developed with Germany’s BioNTech SE. Chile secured deals for third doses of Covid-19 vaccines from Sinovac and Pfizer in the event they are needed in upcoming months, according to a government official. An additional 7 million Sinovac shots and 5 million from Pfizer would arrive by year’s end if health authorities deem them necessary, Vice Minister of Trade Rodrigo Yanez said in an interview. Officials also want to be ready in the event people under 18 years of age are cleared for the shot, he said. Chile is forging ahead with one of the world’s fastest vaccination drives that’s already delivered at least one shot to over 40% of citizens. The deals set it further apart from emerging markets such as Brazil and Mexico that have lagged in their inoculations. Still, the South American nation is struggling to tame a virus surge that sent daily cases to record highs this month. Greta Thunberg’s foundation has donated 100,000 euros ($120,000) to Covax, the global initiative to ensure equitable access to vaccines. “During crises like these, we need to take a few steps back and act for the greater good of society,” she said at a World Health Organization digital media briefing on Monday. The 18-year-old climate activist argued that the world should prioritize the most vulnerable, whether they live in a rich or poor country. She also condemned Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, saying he had “failed to take the responsibility necessary” to safeguard humanity’s living conditions. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo boosted the capacity at indoor venues as statewide infections continue to decline. Starting April 26, capacity at museums and zoos will be raised to 50%, and to 33% at movie theaters. On May 19, capacity at large indoor arenas like Madison Square Garden will be increased to 25%. New York City’s positive test rate for Covid-19 dipped below 5% for the first time in several months as daily vaccinations reached a record, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio. The seven-day average for positive tests fell to 4.91% as of Friday, below a key public-health safety threshold established a year ago. On the same day, the city set a record for vaccinations with 106,528, bringing the total to 5,746,378 doses to date. The number of New York state residents who say they don’t plan to get the Covid-19 vaccine dropped to 14% in April from 25% in January, according to a new Siena College poll out Monday. Political party, residency and demographics revealed the biggest divisions: 22% of Republicans polled said they weren’t planning to get vaccinated, compared with 11% of Democrats; 18% of New York City residents polled said they wouldn’t get jabbed, compared with 8% in the city’s suburbs; And 21% of Latinos polled said they didn’t want the shot, compared with 13% of White residents and 16% of Black respondents.Half of adult New Yorkers have received at least one shot, Governor Andrew Cuomo said last week. The Monday poll surveyed 801 New York state registered voters from April 1-15, before the federal government paused the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Cameroon received 391,212 AstraZeneca doses over the weekend, the first batch out of a total 1.7 million it’s expecting from the Covax facility backed by the World Health Organization, according to Public Health Minister Manaouda Malachie. The central African nation, which has received 592,412 shots so far, is planning to vaccinate at least 15 million people. Cameroon was one of the last African countries to start vaccinating against Covid-19 after shunning AstraZeneca shots over early concerns about its side effects. It eventually received 200,000 Covid-19 doses from China’s Sinopharm Group Co. on April 11, allowing it to kick-start its inoculation program. An analysis of the 3.8 million Russians who received both Sputnik V shots between December and March showed that the vaccine has 97.6% efficacy, the inoculation’s state-run developers said in a statement Monday. The data, which compare the infection rate of people who received the shots with the incidence among the unvaccinated population, will be published in a peer-reviewed journal in May, according to the Russian Direct Investment Fund and Gamaleya National Research Center. Sputnik V demonstrated efficacy of 91.6% in a preliminary analysis of its Phase 3 study that was published in The Lancet in February. Coca-Cola Co.’s sales beat expectations in the first quarter as the soda maker said it saw early -- though uneven -- signs of recovery in demand, particularly in areas with stronger rates of vaccination against Covid-19. The results hint at a potential rebound as consumers worldwide emerge from more than a year of isolation, a process that is happening at different rates in different countries. United Airlines Holdings Inc. will fly three new seasonal routes to Europe as the carrier tries to capitalize on business in destinations now open to Americans ready to fly internationally. The carrier said Monday it would begin flights in July from Newark, New Jersey, to Dubrovnik, Croatia; Washington to Athens; and Chicago to Reykjavik, Iceland. The flights to Greece and Iceland will be daily while the Croatia flight will operate three times weekly. All three will end on Oct. 3. The U.S. State Department plans to caution against travel to about 80% of the world. The World Health Organization said it’s working intensively to get pre-qualification for Russian and Chinese vaccines. The European Union exercised its option for a further 100 million doses of Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s Covid-19 vaccine, boosting its order from the companies to 600 million doses. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson canceled a visit to India next week amid soaring coronavirus cases in the country and the emergence of a new variant.

Indian drugmaker Cadila Healthcare Ltd., which expects regulatory approval for its vaccine by June, will potentially ramp up capacity to 240 million annual doses as the South Asian nation races to contain the world’s fastest-growing coronavirus outbreak. Cadila is expecting efficacy readings from its last stage of clinical trials in May, Sharvil Patel, the family-run firm’s managing director, said in an interview. If that data is promising, the drugmaker may double its vaccine making capabilities and is banking on a new local factory that will likely be commissioned next month, according to Patel.

Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE expect to deliver more vaccines to the European Union this quarter than currently targeted. Denmark became the first EU country to drop AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine from its pandemic inoculation program, reflecting the same concerns over blood clots that prompted the J&J pause. Russia said there have been no cases of clotting with its Sputnik vaccine. A Centers and Disease Control and Prevention panel is considering imposing a monthlong pause on the distribution of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, following reports of rare blood clots among several women who got the shot. Sarah Long, a member of the panel and professor at Drexel University, says she’s in favor of a monthlong pause and she would be opposed to resuming use of J&J’s vaccine at this point. The panelists are the 15 voting members of an advisory committee. They make recommendations for the CDC, which ultimately has the final say. They are highly respected and any decision they make will carry tremendous weight. Michigan health officials won’t issue new orders shutting down parts of the state economy in an attempt to combat the state’s surging Covid-19 cases, Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced Wednesday. Health officials in the state are concerned tighter restrictions might just lead to more noncompliance. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services reported 7,955 new cases Wednesday as roughly two dozen Michigan hospitals neared in-patient capacity. About 18% of Michigan hospital beds are occupied by people with the virus, state officials said Wednesday. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo moved the curfew on bars and restaurants to midnight from 11 p.m. The closing time for catered events will shift to 1 a.m. from midnight, he said in a briefing Wednesday. The changes will take effect Monday. Vaccine hesitancy in the U.S. is shrinking, though 1 in 7 residents remain wary about getting a Covid-19 vaccine, largely because of concerns about side effects. That segment is younger and less educated than average, according to a tracker released Wednesday by the U.S. Census Bureau that uses Household Pulse Survey data. Residents were surveyed before U.S. regulators on Tuesday recommended pausing Johnson & Johnson vaccines because of concerns about rare blood clots. Denver ended its outdoor mask mandate but will continue to require masks on public transit and indoor events, Mayor Michael Hancock announced Wednesday. AstraZeneca’s vaccine may be linked to “very rare events of blood clots,” but the benefits of the shot outweigh its potential risk, Health Canada said in a statement following an assessment of scientific data. The federal agency has updated warnings about the possible side effects in product information and is providing information about potential symptoms as well as when to seek prompt medical attention following vaccination. Johnson & Johnson will revise protocols on its Covid-19 vaccine study and exclude pregnant health workers from a trial in South Africa set to include 500,000 people. The move came after U.S. regulators paused the shot’s rollout on concerns of a rare and severe blood-clotting side effect. While all studies are delayed, plans to run trials on children and pregnant women in South Africa have been set aside for now, said Glenda Gray, the co-lead of the South African studies, in an interview on Wednesday. The research team will meet with South African regulators later on Wednesday, she said. The risk of being exposed to the Covid-19 virus on an airline flight drop by as much as half when airlines keep middle seats open, a new study published by the U.S. government concludes, a safety practice the carriers have abandoned. The study is the latest to roil the waters on a controversial topic: just how risky it is to travel during the pandemic. It didn’t attempt to estimate infection risks and was based on modeling done before the pandemic, so it didn’t consider rules that now require face masks on flights. The risk of coming in contact with the virus dropped by 23% to 57% if airlines limited passenger loads on both single-aisle and widebody jets, compared with full occupancy, according to research released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday. U.S. spy agencies have yet to determine the source of the virus that causes Covid-19, top intelligence officials told the Senate Intelligence Committee Wednesday. Avril Haines, the director of National Intelligence, said analysts are still examining two theories: animal-to-human transmission, and the possibility of a laboratory accident. “The intelligence community does not know exactly where, when or how Covid-19 virus was transmitted initially,” Haines said. CIA Director William Burns, echoed Haines’ assessment, adding that “the Chinese leadership has not been fully forthcoming or fully transparent” in working with the World Health Organization to pinpoint the origin of the coronavirus. The spy chiefs’ assessments add to a growing number of top politicians and public health experts who argue that the theory of a lab leak warrants further investigation. In late March, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a mission to study the origins of the virus was too quick to dismiss the theory of a lab leak. The developers of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine said it hasn’t produced any instances of the dangerous blood-clotting that forced U.S. officials to urge a pause in the use of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine. Sputnik’s first dose uses the same human adenovirus as the Johnson & Johnson inoculation, but they have “significant differences in their structure” and it isn’t appropriate to extrapolate safety data from one to the other, the state-run Gamaleya Center said in a statement. Switzerland will allow theaters, cinemas and outdoor dining at restaurants to open starting Monday, pursuing once again a more liberal course than many of its European neighbors. While facilities will be subject to capacity limitations, the move stands in contrast to France, where officials have responded to an increase in Covid-19 infections by doubling down on restrictions. Outdoor events will be limited to 100 people, while indoors at cinemas or concerts the maximum is 50. The European Union’s drug regulator is accelerating its review of blood-clot reports with J&J’s vaccine and said it expects to issue a recommendation next week. EU member states should store doses as they await guidance, and the European Medicines Agency said it will decide shortly whether “regulatory action is necessary.” The Astra vaccine generated a stronger cellular immune response than the Pfizer and BioNTech shot in people over 80 years old, a study by U.K. researchers shows. Responses in T cells -- a type of white blood cell that helps fight viruses -- were seen in 31% of participants receiving the Astra vaccine and 12% of the Pfizer-BioNTech group, according to the University of Birmingham and U.K. Coronavirus Immunology Consortium. Elderly people receiving a single dose of either vaccine showed equivalent antibody responses after five weeks. It’s unclear if the different levels of T cell responses observed will have any impact on clinical effectiveness, the researchers said. WATCH: Johns Hopkins’s Amesh Adalja discusses the pause in the U.S. rollout of J&J’s shot. Source: Bloomberg New York City had to reschedule 4,000 shots on Tuesday due to the Johnson & Johnson pause, according to Health Commissioner Dave Chokshi. The “vast majority” of New Yorkers will keep the same appointments but receive the Pfizer or Moderna shots instead. The city’s homebound senior vaccine program, which depended on the J&J shot, will be suspended through Sunday, but the city is working to reschedule appointments and arrange transports by taxi or ambulette, Chokshi said. Denmark has become the first country in the European Union to drop AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine from its inoculation program amid concerns over blood clots. Denmark was one of the first countries to suspend the vaccine, on March 11. At the time, the Danish Health Authority called the decision a precautionary move and reiterated its view that Astra’s vaccine was “effective and safe.” Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE will raise Covid-19 vaccine deliveries to the European Union by 50 million this quarter, offering good news to the bloc after Johnson & Johnson’s shot was paused. The drugmakers will bring forward deliveries scheduled for the fourth quarter, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday. The additional supplies will add to the 200 million doses the EU was already expecting from Pfizer through June. The company provided about 66 million in the first three months of the year. European Union governments reached a deal on technical standards for so-called vaccine passports, advancing the effort to boost travel to and within the bloc in time for the summer season. Envoys meeting in Brussels unanimously supported a draft legal text setting out specifics for “digital green certificates,” according to a diplomat familiar with the private meeting. The documents will provide proof their holders have been vaccinated against the coronavirus, tested negative or have recently recovered from the disease and are considered immune. South Africa said drugmakers including J&J demanded “unreasonable terms” in exchange for vaccine supplies. Germany’s rate of infections climbed further beyond a key threshold, and EU governments reached a deal on technical standards for so-called vaccine passports.

A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel ended discussion about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine without taking a vote, leaving it unclear how long the distribution of the shot will remain paused in the U.S. Some panel members advocated for a monthlong pause, while others were concerned about the effects of not having the J&J vaccine available, especially to the communities it was being targeted toward. As a result, distribution of the vaccine will remain halted at least until the panel meets next, perhaps in a week to 10 days.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-30/the-best-tools-to-take-the-pain-out-of-the-points-and-miles-game,2021-06-30T07:30:12.418Z,The Best Tools to Take the Pain Out of the Points-and-Miles Game,[],Pursuits,"Four new apps and services that’ll change the way you earn—and spend—travel rewards.  A first-class cabin on a British Airways flight. The complexity of the points-and-miles landscape is intense enough to make even professionals’ heads spin. Many airlines have abandoned award charts, making it harder to discern how many miles or points you need to unlock that first-class ticket to the Maldives—as well as whether your redemption value is a rip-off or a good deal. Amassing 500,000 Delta SkyMiles for a lie-flat business class seat from New York to Sydney may sound like the points and miles version of shooting for the stars, for instance—until you realize you can get it for 160,000 AAdvantage miles instead. Even on a more fundamental scale, it’s hard to keep track of which cards to use in order to earn the most points on any given swipe. “There is no one-card-fits-all approach,” says Adam Gwosdof, the airdesk product manager for Skylark, a luxury travel agency. “Unless you carry around a printed spreadsheet, you need an app to tell you the best card to use for each transaction you make.” Gwosdof, who often helps people redeem their miles and points, has some favorites: The Points Guy app and the Award Hacker website are his go-tos, though the former is still in beta and not yet available to the general public. When it can be downloaded by the masses later this year, it will be a one-stop shop offering real-time tips on which cards to use for specific purchases, expert advice on how to maximize the points you’ve earned, and notifications when any of them are set to expire. It’ll also offer an “explorer” tool to let you see how transferring points among various programs can boost their value and unlock better redemptions. Luckily for consumers, it’s just one of many tools helping them parse an increasingly complicated landscape. We review four of them to help get you started. The general premise: Identify whether the plastic in your wallet is really working for you—and which cards to sign up for if you’re not milking your current benefits. Why we like it: After you enter the details of everything in your wallet, Gigapoints analyzes your spending patterns to determine if you are earning the maximum reward value with the cards you have. The company uses a third-party service called Plaid to manage password authentication, and has CIA-backed safeguards for data privacy and protection. The initial setup takes some patience, but the rewards come quickly. The app suggests credit cards that may better match your spending patterns, helping customers get an additional $1,000 a year in benefits, on average, be it through cash back, points, or miles. It also suggests cards that address big-picture points and miles goals, like prioritizing free flights, hotel redemptions, or cash back. The developers are also available for free phone consultations if the recommendations require parsing—or if you have very specific goals, like saving for a stay in an overwater bungalow—though you can also filter the results based on simpler criteria, like earning the most airline miles or hotel points. The caveat: Users will have to wait for future versions of the app to explore valuable secondary benefits such as lounge access and retail credits. Like the Points Guy, its business model also hinges on commissions from credit card signups, which can put off some users.  The general premise:  Get the most miles out of every airfare purchase. App in the Air helps you figure out which loyalty program to use when you’re shopping for flights by analyzing the oft-confusing, nitty-gritty criteria like fare class and the earning potential tied to your specific elite status. Why we like it: If you’re loyal to one airline, you may be surprised to learn that competitors may reward you with more. App in the Air makes it easy to know if that’s the case by adding mile earnings to the traditional aviation marketplace interface. It searches routes from more than 200 airlines and shows how many miles you’d earn on any given flight, so if you’re aiming to fly from New York to Miami, for instance, you can see that a fare on American Airlines would earn five miles per dollar spent—unless you book basic economy, in which case none of those miles would be elite-qualifying. Buy the same type of basic economy flight on Delta and you’ll earn five miles per dollar spent, plus miles that work toward achieving elite status. Over time, that could make the difference between, say, qualifying for Gold or Platinum tiers, which unlock additional earning power and travel perks. It’ll also factor in the particulars of your existing elite status on any number of loyalty programs. The caveat: You can’t currently sort results by the number of miles earned, which means you have to scroll through a longer list to get a sense of the relative highs and lows. The company says this feature is in the works. The general premise: Search more than 60 loyalty programs and their transfer partners to identify the cheapest redemptions on specific flight routes and travel dates. Why we like it: This app is the newer, fresher, faster version of Juicy Miles, a popular service that helps book award travel, and no wonder: It was created by the same founder. It will be fully released in July and will scour more airline and credit card programs for redemption values than any other tool, making it the best place to comparison shop when using hard-earned miles. The interface is simple and makes it easy to pinpoint the cheapest redemptions of specific itineraries. For example, a New York to Istanbul redemption via Delta SkyMiles may cost 200,000 miles, but the same city pair may only take 70,000 miles via United MileagePlus. Don’t have any United miles? No worries. Point.me suggests transfer partners that allow you to convert currency and snag the deal. The caveat: Valuable services don’t come free, and while there’s a no-cost version of the app, it’s fairly opaque and will tell you only whether award space is available on certain dates, not which redemption partner to use. To see the full details, you'll have to fork over for access. For unlimited award trip searches, the service costs $5 for a five-day pass, $12 for monthly access, or $99 for a year. The general premise: Use geolocation data to helps users determine which credit card to use, depending on the card bonuses that may be applicable wherever you are, be it a grocery story, gas station, or restaurant. Why we like it: Many cards offer bonuses when you spend on categories such as dining or travel—but it’s easy to forget which one’s which. Card Curator eliminates the guesswork, sending relevant text notifications to prevent the average user from leaving thousands of points and miles on the table. If you’re in a supermarket, for instance, it will remind you that your new American Express Platinum card offers 10x points on groceries in its first six months. You can use the service without geolocation data by simply selecting a category from a drop-down menu before picking the plastic to swipe at check-out. It’s a straightforward and effective proposition: We saw our point balances swell almost immediately after downloading it. The caveat: The app’s functionality is limited: It helps you amass points but doesn’t tell you what you can do with them. A premium version coming in August will cost $6 a month and offer a goal-setting feature; you’ll be able to input a trip you’d like to book with miles and then spend strategically to save up for it. Current users will be grandfathered into the  premium version for free, so take advantage while you can."

The airline is exercising options for Max 7 jets, the smallest version of the narrow-body aircraft, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday. The deal will bring the size of Southwest’s planned Max 7 fleet to 234 aircraft and its total Max order book to 660, cementing the carrier’s status as the model’s biggest customer. Southwest is stocking up on the jets -- undoubtedly at very attractive prices -- as U.S. airlines battle over a resurgence in leisure travel, said George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Discounters such as Frontier Group Holdings Inc. and Spirit Airlines Inc. are targeting the kinds of routes between secondary markets that Southwest has long dominated, as are startups Breeze Aviation Group Inc. and Avelo Airlines. “When I look at leisure in the U.S., it’s outright competitive,” Ferguson said. “These guys are playing the Southwest game, popping into smaller markets.” Southwest rose less than 1% to $58.80 at 12:08 p.m. in New York trading, in line with a Standard & Poor’s index of the five largest U.S. carriers. Boeing slipped less than 1% to $251.04. The Max 7 deal extends the 150-seat model as a mainstay of Southwest’s fleet, complementing the 175-seat Max 8. The smaller plane has a longer range, enabling the Dallas-based carrier to connect cities it can’t now. The jet can also be used for short-distance international routes or service to Hawaii. Southwest accounted for all but a handful of the 208 Max 7 on order, Ferguson said, citing data from Cirium, an aviation analytics company. The carrier booked 100 of the planes in March. The airline now expects to spend about $1.5 billion on aircraft next year, up from its previous projection of roughly $700 million, according to the filing. Beyond plans to grow, the airline has said it needs to replace as many as 35 older 737-700 aircraft that it plans to retire each year over the next 10 to 15 years. While Southwest has a higher cost base than its upstart rivals, it has a better chance to matching their fares and still make money by shifting to smaller planes obtained at “bargain-basement prices,” Ferguson said. Boeing has offered discounts on new orders to save cash and compensate customers after two deadly Max crashes spurred the longest jetliner grounding in U.S. history.  The Dallas-based carrier also moved forward another 64 existing Max 7 options to between 2023 and 2025, and added 32 new options for aircraft that could be delivered in 2026 and 2027. Southwest is evaluating its remaining 40 Max options for 2022. Leisure travel and fares continue to improve, the airline said, as more people are vaccinated against Covid-19 and virus cases decline. June operating revenue will be at the higher end of Southwest’s previous expectations, and will improve further in July, while fares in both months should be comparable to prepandemic rates. The carrier is adding back flying capacity to meet demand, and expects to operate at 97% of 2019 levels in July. Southwest also is seeing “modest consistent improvements” in business travel, with corporate revenue down 77% last month from the same period in 2019, compared with a 90% drop in February."

The Department of Transportation, which has worked with the State Department, said Tuesday it intends to impose the restrictions after giving the public two days to comment. The DOT’s statement didn’t say when it will begin blocking such travel. Source: AFP via Getty Images While passenger traffic is limited between the U.S. and Belarus, the action would be a symbolic move to register continuing U.S. concern over the detention of Raman Pratasevich, a Belarusian journalist and Lukashenko critic. The action came after the State Department determined that the action is in the “foreign policy interests” of the U.S. as a result of the plane’s diversion, according to the statement. Pratasevich was taken off a Ryanair Holdings Plc plane on May 23 after it was forced to land in Belarus under what Western governments called false pretenses. The plane was flying over Belarus while en route from Greece to Lithuania. The prohibition would allow U.S. officials to grant exceptions for travel for national security or humanitarian purposes, the DOT said. It would prohibit the sale of airline tickets from the U.S. to Belarus, including on airlines other than those operating between America and the Eastern European nation. Bloomberg reported the expected action earlier Tuesday. Within days of Pratasevich’s detention, the Biden administration announced sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises, joining the European Union, U.K. and other nations including Canada in retaliating against Lukashenko’s regime. The Federal Aviation Administration at the same time urged U.S. passenger-flight crews operating over Belarus to exercise “extreme caution” but stopped short of a ban on overflights of the region. The European Union’s air-safety regulator has advised airlines to avoid Belarus airspace. Pratasevich in recent days was moved to house arrest after he and his girlfriend, who was also detained, reached an agreement with the government, according to a government statement."

The lifting of travel restrictions will trigger a sharp rebound in corporate travel, executives from Qatar Airways, IAG SA and Rwandair said Tuesday on a panel at the Qatar Economic Forum. Business-class occupancy on Qatar Airways flights is 10 percentage points higher than it was before the pandemic in markets where travel is allowed, said Akbar Al Baker, chief executive officer of the Gulf carrier. “People don’t like to just sit in front of a screen and conduct business,” Al Baker said. “Businessmen like to face people, they like to feel people, they like to notice the body language.” Even as air travel slowly rebounds with the rollout of vaccines gathering pace in most major economies, getting business travel back on track is a key objective for airlines since the premium seats are such a big profit contributor. With face-to-face travel cut off, many companies have adopted new methods of reaching out to customers and co-workers. Those adjustments, along with a rising imperative to reduce carbon emissions, has led to questions about whether corporate road warriors will return in force after the health crisis is over. “The shape of business travel may change, but face-to-face meetings are going to be crucial,” said Luis Gallego, CEO of British Airways parent IAG. About half of IAG’s corporate customers -- a group which contributed about 13% of the carrier group’s revenue pre-pandemic -- have said that they will fly before the end of the year, Gallego said. A measure of relief may be coming, as the U.K. prepares to allow Britons who have been fully vaccinated to travel to more than 150 medium-risk countries by August without the need to quarantine on their return. Read:U.K. Poised to Ease Travel Curbs for Fully Vaccinated in August While companies may cut down on internal travel, they will continue to send executives to meet customers and build new markets, Boeing Co. CEO David Calhoun said on the same panel. “It’s a net gain for travel,” Calhoun said. “We live on competition, competition is what drives travel.” Before any of that can happen, travel restrictions need to be lifted, aviation officials maintain. Carriers are pushing for governments to coordinate on rules to help reopen international and long-distance routes. “Vaccinated people should be able to travel freely,” said Rwandair CEO Yvonne Makolo. Otherwise, continued quarantines and travel restrictions will continue to disrupt the industry and delay the recovery, she said.

The U.S. “must be a leader” in efforts already underway in other regions to implement such travel passports, groups including Airlines for America said in a letter Monday to Jeffrey Zients, the head of President Joe Biden’s Covid-19 recovery team. It’s essential for the government to partner with carriers and the travel industry “to quickly develop” standards, they said. Increasing numbers of vaccinations and slowing rates of disease in many countries are expected to trigger a surge in travel after many consumers spent a year staying close to home to avoid contracting coronavirus. Covid-19 Health Certificates, or CHCs, are seen as essential to reopening many nations that have imposed quarantines or other restrictions on travelers from other countries. The U.S. currently requires a negative Covid-19 test for those entering the country by airplane. “The current diverse and fragmented digital health credentials used to implement different countries’ air travel testing requirements risk causing confusion, reducing compliance and increasing fraud,” the groups said. “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can help lead the global discussion, increasing certainty that test results are legitimate, prioritizing passenger privacy, improving operational efficiency for the aviation industry ecosystem, and strengthening protections against importation of the virus.” Members of the European Union also face increasing pressure from voters and businesses for a road map to end lockdowns and restrictions. The European Commission will unveil a proposal this month for a “Digital Green Pass” that will provide proof that a person has been vaccinated, recovered from Covid-19, or has received a negative test. Such documentation also could be used eventually at sports arenas, theme parks, business meetings and restaurants, according to the letter, which was signed by 27 groups, including the Air Traffic Control Association, the Global Business Travel Association, Airports Council International-North America, the Allied Pilots Association and the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA."

Revenue per available room, which combines occupancy and prices, increased 5.7% last week compared to the same period in 2019, according to data from lodging analytics firm STR. RevPar in Phoenix increased 43% from 2019, the highest among major markets, while New Orleans and San Francisco notched the steepest decline. Hotels in New York City also continue to struggle. While demand from vacationers is expected to remain strong, the hotel industry will have to wait for corporate travelers to return to the road before it sees a fully recovery. That’s unlikely to happen before September."

By subscribing to the rights offering, the government would limit dilution of its 20% shareholding, while increasing its chances of success, said the people, who asked not to be identified prior to a decision. Lufthansa is working with banks to raise about 3 billion euros in equity, people familiar with the matter said previously. Europe’s largest carrier received government support last year, after the coronavirus pandemic gutted air travel and damaged the finances of many of the industry’s largest players. Proceeds from the offering will go toward paying down a 5.5 billion-euro “silent participation” that was part of the bailout, Lufthansa has said. The airline pays interest on the hybrid debt-equity security, with payments set to rise steeply in coming years. Refinancing the bailout package is an immediate priority for the company, executives have said. Lufthansa’s publicly traded debt rose on the Bloomberg report. The company’s 600 million euros of notes due November 2025 were bid around 1 cent on the euro higher at 10 a.m. Frankfurt time. Shares in the airline gained 2.1%. The plan to raise capital leaves the state with a decision: stand pat, letting its stake shrink before a recovery has been assured, or participate at the risk of overstepping European Union limits on aid to the flag carrier. Lufthansa’s biggest private shareholder, the heirs of billionaire Heinz Hermann Thiele, last month sold down part of the family’s holding. Government officials have insisted that the state should keep a significant investment in the airline while taxpayer cash is on the line. But the move would likely face opposition from Ireland’s Ryanair Holdings Plc, which has filed EU legal complaints against the bailout package. “There is little doubt that Germany supports Lufthansa in the investment community,” said Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein. “The biggest guarantor of success for a rights issue would be a plan how to achieve profitability despite 20% fewer planes and 15% fewer business travelers post crisis.” One option under consideration would see Germany sell off some of its subscription rights, then use those proceeds to purchase new shares, the people said. While this would free taxpayers from committing more cash, the government’s holding in Lufthansa would shrink -- albeit to a lesser degree than if the government didn’t participate at all. Another option is for the government to make use of more, if not all, of its subscription rights and spend up to 1 billion euros, the people said. The framework aid agreement allows for a rights offering that includes up to 1 billion euros contribution from the state if fully exercised. A Lufthansa spokesman declined to comment. Representatives for the German finance ministry and the European Commission didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.  Aid to Lufthansa has come under scrutiny by the EU before. Der Spiegel reported in March that Margrethe Vestager, the bloc’s antitrust chief, threatened legal action against Germany after the company made an interest payment on a hybrid bond without informing the EU. The terms of EU approval for the bailout also included a ban on dividends. The company said in May that it froze coupons on hybrid bonds to comply with EU rules. Lufthansa continues to lose money as the coronavirus pandemic restricts global travel. The airline reduced its monthly cash drain to 235 million euros in the first quarter, and expects that figure to narrow to 200 million euros per month in the current period, helping it to a smaller operating loss than the 5.5 billion euros posted last year. Executive pay and M&A activity at the airline is restricted until the government aid is repaid."

Enter the 12-minute helicopter ride. Weekday helicopter service between Westchester County Airport and Manhattan is slated to arrive as early as March, according to Rob Wiesenthal, chief executive officer of Blade Urban Air Mobility. Trips of up to five passengers, with Covid-safety protocols, will cost $175 each way. “We believe people will be willing to pay to go once a week by Blade, because we’re saving so much friction,” Wiesenthal said. “These people are working remotely four days a week, and it can feel comfortable to do this once a week.” Blade is piloting the program after success in and out of the Hamptons last year. The company in December agreed to merge with Experience Investment Corp., a special purchase acquisition firm backed by private equity firm KSL Capital Partners, which in turn owns Ross Aviation. The helicopter commute will run from Ross’s terminal in Westchester, while Blade’s outpost there will continue to serve as a base for long-haul flights. Ross and Blade are also working on a plan to introduce vertiports -- vertical take-off and landing stations -- and electric aircraft within four years. Expanding access to safe and quick commutation could play a role in New York City’s recovery if people move further from the city and want to make the most of their in-person time in the office. “The helicopter and vertical technology are going to surge, because of the savings in time,” said Mitchell Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management. “It’s one of the best investments, because you can be twice as productive when you’re in your Manhattan high rise office: You can do far more in face to face, which makes the helicopter worth it.” To be sure, the vast majority will still have to travel by train, subway or car. “There’s a new hierarchy of how you commute,” Moss said. “The helicopter is superseding the limousine and the SUV for hedge-fund executives and high-tech leaders.”"

U.S. government officials monitoring the airways say they won’t tolerate passengers who refuse to don masks as airline travel surges ahead of the summer season. A recent spike in unruly passenger reports, many of them involving people refusing to cover their faces, prompted Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Tuesday to issue a stern warning to travelers. “Let me be clear in underscoring something,” Mayorkas said at a press conference at Washington Reagan National Airport in Virginia. “It is a federal mandate that one must wear a mask in an airport, in the modes of public transportation, on the airplane itself -- and we will not tolerate behavior that violates the law.” Mayorkas didn’t specify how passengers would be punished, but both the Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration have the authority to fine passengers who violate the law. In extreme cases, such as assaulting flight crews, people can face federal criminal charges. In the past two weeks, the FAA has proposed fines against nine passengers who allegedly interfered with flight attendants, including several in which flight crews were physically assaulted. Passenger counts still lag behind pre-pandemic times, but have risen dramatically this year. Since late January, the low point for air travel this year, airlines have added almost 1 million passengers a day on average, or an increase of about 150%. For the past week, about 1.6 million people a day passed through airport security checks, according to the Transportation Security Administration. That was about 68% of the same period in 2019, before the pandemic hit. Despite fewer passengers, federal agencies have received thousands of complaints about unruly behavior this year. Out of 2,500 such reports, the vast majority -- 1,900 -- involved allegations that people had violated the mask requirement, the Federal Aviation Administration said on Monday. The FAA said it had taken enforcement actions in 30 cases and had found potential violations in 395 cases."

Earlier on Monday, Artiom Sikorskiy, director of aviation at the Belarus Transportation Ministry, told reporters that an email from people claiming to be Hamas fighters demanded that Israel stop fighting in Gaza and for the EU to withdraw support for Israel. Belarusian journalist Raman Pratasevich appeared in a video posted by state-owned media channels late Monday, denying reports that he’s suffering from health issues and that he is in the hospital. The circumstances of the video were unclear and it’s unkown if he was coerced into giving the statement. “I continue to cooperate with the investigation and am confessing evidence of organizing mass unrest in Minsk,” he said in the video, adding that his treatment is consistent with the law. Lufthansa will suspend operations in Belarusian airspace “for the time being,” a company spokesperson said in an email. Earlier Monday, a Lufthansa flight from Minsk to Frankfurt was held for 2 hours after its scheduled time of departure. The airline had said that it was cooperating with local authorities who were “searching the aircraft again before departure and subjecting the passengers to another security check” after receiving a security alert during boarding. Belarusian Interior Ministry spokeswoman Olga Chemodanova denied reports that Pratasevich had been transferred to hospital with serious health problems. Chemodanova said on her Telegram account that Pratasevich hasn’t complained about his health and is still being held in jail in Minsk. Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski earlier told TVN24 television that his government has received reports from Pratasevich’s mother that her son has “very serious” health conditions. Jablonski said such information is “very worrisome” given the unexplained deaths among members of Belarussian opposition who have been arrested in recent months. Inessa Olenskaya, Pratasevich’s lawyer, said by phone from Minsk that she couldn’t immediately confirm his condition and didn’t have information about his whereabouts. Leaders at the summit have been asked not to use electronic devices, including their mobile phones, during the talks on Belarus and on Russia. Summit chair Charles Michel, who heads the European Council, requested the move “to ensure the confidentiality of the discussion,” his spokesman Barend Leyts tweeted. Ursula von der Leyen, head of the EU’s executive arm, pledged that the bloc will ensure “a very strong answer because it is outrageous behavior and Lukashenko and his regime have to understand this will have serious consequences.” On her way into the summit, the chief of the European Commission said leaders will explore “sanctions against individuals that are involved in this hijacking but also sanctions against business and economic entities that are financing this regime. And we are looking into sanctions against the aviation sector in Belarus.” Von der Leyen said a previously prepared 3 billion-euro ($3.7 billion) investment and economic package by the EU “is on hold and frozen until Belarus turns democratic.” Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo told reporters before the meeting that the bloc would act quickly. “This is a flight between two European capitals where European citizens have been used as hostages in an illegal arrest,” he said. “We will propose rapid, swift and severe measures are being taken to make it very clear that something like this is not being accepted.” On her way into the summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for further sanctions against Belarusian officials and a ban on overflights. She called the actions of Belarus authorities “without precedent” and said their explanations were “totally uncredible.” The White House demanded an international investigation of Belarus’s forced landing of the Ryanair plane, calling it an “affront” by Lukashenko’s government. “This was a shocking act, diverting a flight between two EU member states for the apparent purpose of arresting a journalist,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Monday. “It constitutes a brazen affront to international peace and security by the regime. We demand an immediate international transparent and credible investigation of this incident.” She said the U.S. government is “in touch” with allies about the incident, and the U.S. ambassador to Belarus has conveyed the Biden administration’s concerns “directly.” White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan also “raised our strong concerns” about Belarus’s action with his Kremlin counterpart. Russia is Belarus’s closest ally. EU leaders are expected to use the following wording in their joint communique on Belarus, according to a senior diplomat familiar with the ongoing drafting of the text: It could be complicated for airlines to avoid Belarusian airspace given its location and the fact that there are other restricted flight areas nearby, according to Director General of the International Air Transport Association Willie Walsh. He told Bloomberg Television’s Guy Johnson and Alix Steel that airlines that are still flying over Belarus will have assessed the risk. “We do have to strongly condemn the actions of the government of Belarus,” Walsh said. “What they did on Sunday, intercepting a commercial civil aircraft, clearly put the passengers and crew of that aircraft at risk. Forcing them to divert is unacceptable behavior by any government.” The U.K. summoned the Belarusian ambassador to London to explain the forced landing of a commercial plane and arrest of journalist Raman Pratasevich, according to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. Raab told Parliament on Monday that the actions by Belarus were an “egregious and extraordinary departure from international law.” “It’s very difficult to believe that this kind of action could’ve been taken without at least the acquiescence of the authorities in Moscow,” Raab said. Raab told Parliament the U.K. has suspended the operating permit on the Belarusian airline Belavia. He added that the Civil Aviation Authority has been instructed not to grant any further ad hoc permits for carriers between the U.K. and Belarus, and to request airlines not to venture into Belarusian airspace. Belarus grounded the Ryanair flight after receiving an emailed bomb threat signed by people claiming to be Hamas fighters, Artiom Sikorskiy, director of aviation at the country’s Transportation Ministry, said during an online briefing Monday. The message included demands for Israel to stop fighting in Gaza and the EU to withdraw support for Israel, and was composed in English, Sikorskiy said. The bomb was allegedly set to explode over Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius. The anonymous email to the Minsk airport was sent just days after the Israel-Palestine truce sparked celebrations in Gaza. European Council President Charles Michel will push for EU leaders to decide on measures against Belarus when they meet for dinner Monday night at the start of a two-day summit. “What happened yesterday is an international scandal. Lives of European civilians were at risk,” Michel said as he arrived at the summit building. “This is not acceptable and this is why we put the debate on sanctions on the table of the European Council.” “We are preparing different options, different possible measures and I hope tonight we can take decisions on that,” he added. “The developments over the weekend are obviously negative and we will await a European response,” Schroders money manager James Barrineau said by email from New York. “We doubt Putin will want to jeopardize his summit with Biden over this issue, but it does not help the overall tone of the relationship of Russia with Europe.” Schroders has a “very small” position in Belarus, and for now does not expect implications for Russian assets from the forced landing of the Ryanair plane in Minsk, he said. Germany summoned the Belarus ambassador to the foreign ministry in Berlin Monday evening to explain why the country forced a Ryanair jet to land in Minsk. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas called the previous explanations from Alexander Lukashenko’s regime “absurd and not credible.” “We need clarity about what really happened on board and on the ground yesterday,” Maas said in a statement. “And we need clarity about the well-being of Raman Pratasevich and his partner, who must be released immediately.” The Lithuanian foreign ministry urged its nationals not to travel to Belarus and recommended those currently in the neighboring country to leave, according to a statement. The incident with the Ryanair plane demonstrates “a threat to security and lives of individuals,” the ministry said. Lufthansa flight LH1487 from Minsk to Frankfurt took off at 4:21 p.m. local time, according to FlightRadar24, 2 hours after its scheduled time of departure. The airline had earlier said that it was cooperating with local authorities who were “searching the aircraft again before departure and subjecting the passengers to another security check” after receiving a security alert during boarding. All 51 people schedule to depart on the flight were on board, according to a Lufthansa spokesperson. Exiled Belarus opposition leader Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya called for sanctions against the country during a Monday phone call with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. She is scheduled to hold a call later in the day with members of President Joe Biden’s administration. Tsikhanouskaya also said the whereabouts of the detained journalist Raman Pratasevich are unknown and his lawyer is unable to contact him. The journalist’s girlfriend, who is a Russian citizen, is being held in a Minsk prison and has been refused assistance from the Russian consulate. Lufthansa flight LH1487 from Minsk to Frankfurt was delayed following a “security alert,” the German airline said in a statement. The Minsk airport said on its Telegram channel that it had received an anonymous email about a planned “terrorist attack.” Lufthansa said 51 passengers, including five crew members, were on board the plane. “We are cooperating with the authorities, who are searching the aircraft again before departure and subjecting the passengers to another security check,” Lufthansa said on Monday. The search includes unloading all suitcases and cargo. WATCH: Brussels vowed to add more sanctions against Belarus while imposing an effective flight blockade on the country. (Source: Bloomberg) The proposals for discussion about EU’s response include banning Belarus airlines from landing in the EU or suspending flights over Belarus’s airspace, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said. He said that according to available information, there were four Russian citizens on the Raynair flight “who probably had a lot to do with this unbelievable act.” “Europe’s response must be tough,” Babis told reporters before departing to EU summit. Lithuania’s criminal police said on Monday that 121 of the 126 passengers who left Athens on the flight arrived in Vilnius. On Sunday, both Greece and Lithuania said 171 passengers and crew were on the flight, which Lithuania said Monday was the number of reservations. There was also confusion over infant passengers, who didn’t require tickets, and some boarding passes that weren’t digital. Ryanair hasn’t confirmed the numbers. Lithuania’s transport member also said the country would ban flights to and from Belarus airspace starting at 3 a.m. on Tuesday. The ban will affect 26 flights a day. Lithuania’s neighbor Poland will propose at the EU summit on Monday that all flights between the bloc and Belarus be halted. Poland has come as one of the strongest voices demanding firm action. At the meeting of leaders in Brussels Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki will propose halting all flights between EU and Belarus. Holding a placard reading “SOS,” Belarusian activists in Poland appealed to the EU for help. Standing in front of Belarus embassy in Warsaw, Nexta founder and blogger Stsiapan Putsila said he’s received “more than a thousand threats” since Sunday. “We can’t stay silent,” said Jana Shostak, another activist. According to Lithuania’s criminal police, 121 of the 126 passengers who left Athens on the flight arrived in Vilnius. The captain of the airliner consulted with Ryanair’s management before deciding to divert to Minsk. On Sunday, both Greece and Lithuania said 171 passengers and crew were on the flight. Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski said on Monday his country was setting up “special protection” for activists on Polish territory who “could be in the cross-hairs of Belarusian or Russian services.” Raman Pratasevich, arrested after the Ryanair plane was diverted to Minsk, worked for Nexta, a media group registered and run out of Warsaw. Jablonski urged activists to avoid contact with Belarus as “we can’t tell what the regime is capable of.” “Nothing is off the table,” a French diplomat told journalists when asked about possible punitive measures against Belarus. In addition to sanctions targeting Belarusian officials and companies, the EU is mulling the suspension of overflights of European airlines over Belarus, a landing ban for flag carrier Belavia in European airports, and the suspension of transits (including land) from Belarus to the EU, the French diplomat added, asking not to be named in line with policy. Flight FR3340 from Paphos, Cyprus, is scheduled to land at Talinn, Estonia, at 2:30 p.m. local time. The route takes the plane directly across Belarus territory, highlighting the mixed messaging coming out of Europe in response to Sunday’s incident. The airspace over Belarus is part of a major route for flights between Asia and Europe, with some carriers including Deutsche Lufthansa AG and cargo hauler FedEx Corp. continuing to fly over the country on Monday. Airlines have routed traffic over Belarus to avoid the restive eastern Ukraine region that’s been off-limits since a Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 jet was shot down there in 2014, killing 298 people. Poland’s state prosecutor said it has ordered an investigation into the landing because the Ryanair jet was registered in Poland and therefore falls under Polish jurisdiction. Estonia plans to raise the Belarus issue at the Security Council and has already started consultations to have a discussion, public broadcaster ERR cited the country’s foreign minister, Eva-Maria Liimets, as saying. Bloomberg’s Maria Tadeo discusses the situation with Nathan Hager on Bloomberg Radio. The diversion of the Ryanair plane to Minsk on Sunday was an “act of aviation piracy,” the airline said in a statement today. Ryanair said it was “fully cooperating” with the EU safety and security agencies as well as NATO, and wouldn’t comment further due to security reasons. Tensions between Moscow’s closest ally and the West over Minsk’s forcing of a Ryanair jet to land won’t affect Russia’s efforts to arrange a summit meeting between President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. Counterpart, Joe Biden, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “I wouldn’t combine all this into a single system,” Peskov told reporters on a conference call. “These are different things, after all.” Peskov declined to comment on the details of the case, including on whether Belarus gave Russia advance warning of its decision to force the plane to land or whether Moscow’s agents were involved. “Our special services are in the closest possible contact,” he said, adding that he doesn’t have detailed information about the Ryanair jet. Western countries are showing double standards, according to Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. “It’s shocking that the West is calling the incident in Belarus’s airspace ‘shocking,’” she wrote in a Facebook post. Zakharova cited past examples of what she said were western governments forcing planes to land, such as a 2013 episode when the plane of Bolivian President Evo Morales had to land in Austria as the U.S. searched for Edward Snowden, as evidence that the U.S. and its allies use the same tactics. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab added to the voices calling for further sanctions against Belarus and the immediate release of Protasevich. In a statement, Raab condemned the arrest, adding “Mr Lukashenko must be held to account for his outlandish actions.” Luggage from Ryanair Flight FR4978 is checked at Minsk International Airport, Belarus on May 23. Source: ONLINER.BY/AFP “Formally, there was a bomb threat, so everything was done properly,” Vladimir Dzhabarov, first deputy chairman of the International Affairs committee in the upper house of parliament, said in a phone interview Monday. “I don’t see anything unusual or unacceptable in the actions of the Belarusian authorities.” The arrest of Raman Pratasevich, the journalist, was justified, he said. “This person was sitting abroad and criticizing his homeland,” he said. “It’s a warning to Tsikhanouskaya,” he said, referring to exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Of the possible options for EU action, sanctions against individuals and entities would likely be the simplest, according to a senior official close to the European talks. Other options, such as the suspension all flights by EU airlines over Belarus and the suspension of all transit -- including ground travel -- between Belarus and the EU, would trigger increased costs for European companies, the official said. “This was a case of state-sponsored hijacking,” Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary said in comments broadcast by RTE Radio. The airline has to do a “detailed debrief today with the NATO and EU authorities” after the incident, which he said saw passengers and crew held under armed guard. It appears the intent of Belarusian authorities was to remove a journalist and his traveling companion, O’Leary said. “We believe there was also some KGB agents offloaded off the aircraft as well,” he said. “This was effectively aviation piracy, state sponsored,” Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney told RTE Radio. The EU’s response “has to be clear, tough, and needs to happen quickly,” he said. Worries over potential sanctions are scaring away bond investors. Belarus’s dollar bonds due 2031 tanked early on Monday, pushing yields up 23 basis points to a one-month high of 7.48%. The bonds traded at a yield of above 8% in August after authorities cracked down on protesters following Lukashenko’s claim to a landslide election victory. Wizz Air Holdings Plc, Eastern Europe’s biggest discount carrier, said it has rerouted a service from the Ukrainian capital Kyiv to Tallinn in Estonia to avoid Belarusian airspace. A spokesman said in an email that the Budapest-based company is “continuously monitoring and evaluating the situation.” Latvia’s national carrier Airbaltic has decided to avoid Belarusian air space “for the time being,” Latvian Transport Minister Talis Linkaits said in interview with Latvijas Radio. Belarus’s neighbor, Poland, will propose new sanctions against Lukashenko’s government at Monday’s EU meeting, according to Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski. He declined to specify the type of measures Warsaw will seek, saying the government wants to consult with EU partners first. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the incident “without precedent” and said explanations from the Belarus government weren’t credible.

When the Ryanair flight was forced to land in Minsk on Sunday, three passengers got off the plane, in addition to the journalist, Pratasevich, and his girlfriend. One of the passengers was Greek and the other two were Belarusian, according to a person familiar with the investigation. The reason these passengers disembarked is unknown, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the investigation is ongoing. “We believe there was also some KGB agents offloaded off the aircraft,” Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary said earlier Monday in comments broadcast by RTE Radio. EU leaders tasked their ministers on Monday to ban overflight of EU airspace by Belarusian Airlines and prevent access to EU airports, according to the summit conclusions posted on Twitter. The leaders also asked European airlines to avoid overflight of Belarus. Moreover, leaders vowed to add more Belarusian officials to an existing sanctions blacklist and adopt a broader set of punitive measures that would target companies and entire sectors of the country’s economy.

Deutsche Lufthansa AG said it plans to repay billions of euros in aid from the German government before the country’s federal election on Sept. 26. Europe’s biggest airline is working on measures to secure the refinancing “hopefully before the general election,” Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr said at Germany’s National Aviation Conference. The comments are a sign of increasing confidence that a shaky comeback of air travel from the coronavirus crisis will finally take hold. Lufthansa is one of the companies that’s set plans to raise capital as the outlook improves. Germany said Friday that more than 50% of its people have now received at least one vaccine dose, while the European Union separately gave the final go-ahead for a reopening of travel with the U.S. Paying back the government aid would free Lufthansa from restrictive conditions the European Commission attached to its approval of the bailout last year. Those terms include a ban on dividends and management bonuses and prevent Lufthansa from acquiring more than a 10% stake in a rival airline. With Chancellor Angela Merkel set to step down, Lufthansa would avoid any uncertainty tied to dealing with the next German leader. “We were one of the first companies to be saved by the federal government,” Spohr said to Merkel at the opening ceremony of the conference. “We also want to be one of the first companies to repay the rescue funds.” Lufthansa said Tuesday it had appointed Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. to help with a capital raising after receiving 9 billion euros ($11 billion) in bailouts to help survive the coronavirus crisis. People familiar with the matter have said it’s aiming to garner 3 billion euros via a rights issue. Lufthansa also said this week it’s seeking to reduce annual expenses by 3.5 billion euros through cuts to labor, office and other costs in a bid to bolster earnings as the travel industry begins to emerge from the pandemic. Shares of Lufthansa advanced 1% to 10.53 euros as of 1:04 p.m. in Frankfurt. The stock has trimmed its losses for the year to 2.6%."

Air Canada’s top executive is growing more optimistic about the chances of a government aid package, as a prolonged travel slump forces the Montreal-based airline to further cut capacity. Canada’s biggest carrier said it expects to burn as much as C$17 million ($13.4 million) in net cash per day this quarter and reported fourth-quarter revenue that trailed analysts’ estimates. Yet outgoing Chief Executive Officer Calin Rovinescu, who has criticized the government of Justin Trudeau for not supporting the industry, struck a more positive tone this time. Air Canada’s retiring CEO, Calin Rovinescu. Passenger traffic at airport checkpoints in January was just 13% of last year’s levels, versus 38% in the U.S., according to data from the countries’ transportation authorities. In the first week of February, it has slipped below 9%. Air Canada has taken advantage of federal wage subsidies, for a net benefit of C$554 million last year, the airline said Friday. But unlike the U.S. and most other developed economies, there has been no dedicated aid package to help airlines withstand the crisis. “Canada remains the lone G-7 country that has thus far not provided any sector specific support to aviation, thereby threatening the long term competitiveness” of Canada’s airline industry, Rovinescu told analysts on a conference call. During the call, Chief Financial Officer Michael Rousseau, who’s taking over as CEO on Monday, indicated the airline would like Canada to do its own version of the U.S. bailout plan, which provided a mix of grants and loans to be used for payroll costs, as well as a separate loan program. If a Canadian aid package is agreed, it needs to take into account all the measures Canadian airlines had to take in almost a year to preserve liquidity, Rovinescu added. Air Canada said it plans to reduce capacity by 85% in the first quarter compared with 2019, more than the 80% expected just a month ago, due to the government’s latest restrictions. It said net cash burn will be between C$15 million and C$17 million in the current quarter, from C$15 million a day the fourth quarter, in parts because of lower advance ticket sales and higher capital expenditures. To boost revenue, it’s planning to build up its cargo business and an e-commerce delivery business. The company also said it’s well placed to take advantage of the recovery, with a modernized narrow-body fleet and hubs in Montreal and Toronto, home to a multicultural population keen to visit friends and family overseas. “Air Canada’s largest roadblock is now the Canadian government’s severe travel restrictions,” Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen & Co., said in a note. “Once the government opens its borders, we believe there will be a rush to the exit. There is significant pent-up demand among Canada’s citizens, who have been locked down for almost a year,” Becker said. Rovinescu said in a statement he’s “very encouraged by the constructive nature of discussions” with the government over a sector-specific package over the last weeks. “While there is no assurance at this stage that we will arrive at a definitive agreement on sector support, I am more optimistic on this front for the first time.” The improvement may be connected to the new measures announced by Trudeau last month, which toughened quarantine rules and led airlines to suspend flights to the Caribbean and Mexico. With already stringent policies in place since March, air travel in Canada hasn’t even begun to bounce back from the Covid-19 crisis. Air Canada shares rose 5.2% to C$22.31 as of 10:50 a.m. in Toronto."

And yes, it’s still early days. Globally, scheduled capacity is stuck at about 58% of pre-pandemic levels, says John Grant, chief analyst at aviation data specialist OAG. For every market that grows, another seems to fall back, he said. With lockdowns meaning hopes of a buoyant European summer season hang  in the balance, Grant says the reality is that airline capacity will hit an average of about 65 to 68 million seats by the end of the year — with passenger demand lagging some 15-20 percentage points behind capacity levels “for a long period of time.” “There maybe light at the end of the tunnel, but it’s a very, very long tunnel we’ve still got to go through.” OAG’s data snapshot for the week of April 12 shows that the U.S. is gaining momentum, with a handful of accessible destinations in the Caribbean benefiting from a recent upturn. Besides Cancun in Mexico, airlines have been ferrying Americans to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where capacity is up 36% versus 2019, Puerto Rico, up 0.5%, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where last week’s  volcanic eruption is likely to erase a 13% gain. Discount carriers in the U.S. have been adding capacity as rising vaccination rates encourage leisure travel. Frontier Group Holdings Inc. and Spirit Airlines Inc. have been the most aggressive, piling on flights just before spring break — though their push has trailed off in the past week. Despite U.S. growth, Asia leads the global pack. China is offering 5.1% more seats than during the same week in 2019. Vietnam is still closed to foreigners but domestic tourism means flight capacity is almost back up to where it was two years ago. A similar dynamic is at play in India, where seats offered are down just 16%. In Europe, the regional hops that embody summer travel are nearly dormant, with countries like Italy, France and Germany stuck at 25% or less of pre-pandemic levels. One surprising development is the handful of bright spots in Africa. The Democratic Republic of Congo leads the way at 41% above pre-pandemic activity. International borders have been open since August in the expansive central African country which is layered in rainforest. War-torn Yemen in the Middle East is another outlier, with capacity offered at 19% above 2019 levels. While Yemenis are unable to fly to many countries, airlines have reintroduced routes to Sudan and Ethiopia, where getting visas is easier. China was quick to bring Covid-19 under control, and has kept infections low. Yet while it continues to help Asian air travel outperform the rest of the world, even that is not enough to see the region restore capacity mothballed since 2019. Asia’s comeback was briefly interrupted by the Lunar New Year break in February, when the Chinese government encouraged people not to travel, OAG’s data show. The recovery has resumed since then. though the pace has flattened in recent weeks. North America got a bump at the start of March, driven by spring break getaways and a powerful U.S. vaccine rollout. That looks set to continue after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this month cleared a return to recreational travel for vaccinated individuals. Muddying the outlook is a rise in infections in the Midwest, which has sent U.S. virus cases to a two-week high. Europe trails every other region by far. A host of factors are at play, ranging from the high reliance on international flights — which complicates border crossings — to the emergence of new virus strains and setbacks in the European Union’s vaccination drive. The U.K., which has had the most success in cutting infections, has  waffled on a May 17 target date for a reopening of international air travel, but says it’s still a goal. United Airlines Holdings Inc., whose normal route network is weighted toward international travel, remains stuck at almost 50% below normal. The Chicago-based carrier has emphasized matching capacity to demand, so that planes fly fuller. Delta Air Lines Inc., another big global carrier, will have more room for passengers on May 1, when it becomes the last U.S. airline to lift its block on selling mid-row seats. While international travel remains suppressed, some large nations are being buoyed by domestic carriers, which have been able to keep flying where train or automobile travel is less practical. Airlines in China and India have kept  accepting single-aisle jet deliveries from Airbus SE. Vietnam, about 1,000 miles from north to south, has also recovered well, with scheduled capacity down just 5.2% from 2019. Yet Singapore and Hong Kong, both reliant on international travel, are barely flying at all. Progress toward establishing flight corridors has been waylaid by virus flareups, despite low case numbers in comparison to Western countries. In Malaysia, where capacity is 85% below 2019 levels, AirAsia Group Bhd. posted a record loss in the final quarter of 2020 after local lockdowns delayed its plan to resume limited operations. While U.S. airlines are bringing back pilots from leave, the coming weeks will show whether March’s rebound can endure. Rising Covid-19 cases there mean the outlook for carriers is becoming less clear, according to analyst Helane Becker of Cowen & Co.  Vaccination rates will be key to lifting travel restrictions. Just this week Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine rollout became the latest to hit obstacles, with the U.S.  pausing use of the shot and its European  rollout delayed after reports of rare instances of blood clotting. Questions have also been raised about the effectiveness of some of China’s vaccines. On a more positive note, the EU on Wednesday reached agreement on a draft of technical standards for so-called  vaccine passports, which promise to ease travel to and within the bloc. But it’s not clear how soon the plan will go into effect. “It’s very difficult on a global basis to see that there are going to be enough vaccinations by the end of 2021 or indeed 2022,” said OAG’s Grant. “It almost makes air travel a luxury product once again, particularly if you need to get tested both before and after arriving back home.” Using weekly OAG updates, Bloomberg has built a global flight tracker to monitor the pulse of the air travel comeback. It’s not one Grant expects to be quick. Measuring seats on offer shows that carriers currently have some 62 million seats per week, well short of the 2019 benchmark of 106 million. While not as precise a measurement as actual passenger traffic, tracking seats offered can help identify trends, giving an early look at what’s happening on a global, regional or national level."

The plan comes as the Malaysia-based budget airline doubles down on its digital strategy as the pandemic continues to wreak havoc on air travel. AirAsia announced Wednesday that it’s buying Gojek’s businesses in Thailand for $50 million through the issuance of shares in AirAsia SuperApp. The airline is also expected to announce a transaction soon at BigPay, where a capital raising will give the unit “a very nice valuation,” Fernandes said, without providing more details. The fintech company has also applied for a digital banking license in Malaysia. AirAsia also sees big opportunities in its logistics arm Teleport, with plans to add a freighter plane in September, Fernandes said. It will receive a leased 737 plane, the first Boeing Co. aircraft on its fleet, as the airline bets on growing demand from online purchases. “Logistics is ready and ripe for disruption,” Fernandes said. “We can be a freight forwarder, we can be a DHL. Teleport is a diamond in the rough.” Teaming up with Gojek will enable AirAsia to provide a vast range of online services from travel and shopping to cross-border deliveries, which will create opportunities for growth. AirAsia has been expanding its digital operations in the last few years and Fernandes said in March the company’s Super App business would have revenue of $250 million this year and digital services will make up about 50% of the company’s sales in five years time. In a separate interview with Bloomberg TV, Fernandes said the company was in the process of working on three other acquisitions. “We will continue to look for acquisitions that make sense,” he said. Ride-hailing and payments giant Gojek in May agreed to combine with e-commerce pioneer PT Tokopedia to create the largest internet company in Indonesia, before seeking a stock-market debut at home and in the U.S. The startups will form a holding company called GoTo through a deal backed by shareholders including Google and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. “AirAsia is all about going to a market and disrupting,” Fernandes said. The airline is about “targeting the markets that no one is looking at, giving them value, and growing that ecosystem,” he said."

The retail crowd bought the dip, snapping up shares of hotels, casinos and cruise lines on Monday at the fastest pace in a year, according to data compiled by Vanda Research that tracks traffic on retail trading platforms and industry-wide order flows. Source: Vanda Research Source: Morgan Stanley At the same time, professional speculators are trimming bets that depended on economic recovery. After selling travel and leisure shares, hedge funds’ net exposure to cyclical stocks last month fell to the lowest level since late 2020, data from Morgan Stanley’s prime broker show. While the face-off may reflect opposite views on how the economic recovery will play out, Michael Purves at Tallbacken Capital Advisors said that it could also be driven by hedge funds’ needs to keep risk under control. In other words, when some money-losing stocks threaten performance, fund managers could be forced to liquidate the positions. “What’s being really revealed is, that investment flexibility of not having to worry about the style drift or being stopped out is an enormous advantage,” Purves said by phone. “There is a wide range of opinions as to how much more you want to be long cyclicals or reflation. The discussion is going on but I think a lot of people still think we’re not in the ninth inning of this, we’re in the fourth inning of it, and they want to stay in the trade.” Read: JPMorgan’s Kolanovic Defends Value After Worst Month in 20 Years The reopening trade took a beating last month as the Delta variant fueled an increase in Covid-19 cases from the U.K. to India. Airlines, for instance, tumbled about 10% as a group for the worst month since March 2020. A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. basket of stocks that are poised to benefit from a return to normal economic activity lost 4%, the most since September. Often seen as momentum chasers, the army of day traders are instead now going bargain hunting. In the second half of June, they scooped up shares that trailed the market -- energy, materials, financials and industrials, according to data from Vanda. Technology -- the best-performing in the S&P 500 Index -- saw its share of single-stock purchases falling to the lowest level in more than a year. By contrast, hedge funds have preferred resilient growers such as tech since mid-May and turned net sellers in value stocks, a cohort dominated by cyclical shares, client data from Morgan Stanley show. It’s the latest example of the conflict between amateur and professional investors in the pandemic era. At the market’s bottom 15 months ago, retail money quickly embraced the reopening trade, while pros were slow to dive in. In January, the hedge-fund industry was forced to retreat from the market after the army of day traders banded together to target the most-shorted stocks. For now, big players are having the upper hand. As Federal Reserve policy makers indicated a hawkish shift, sparking concern that the central bank may not let the economy run too hot, the reflation trade started to show signs of cracking. The Russell 1000 Value Index trailed its growth counterpart by roughly 8 percentage points in June, the most in two decades. “At the root of this shift in behavior there is a major institutional reallocation out of value and reopening into tech; a similar situation to Q2 2020,” Vanda analysts Ben Onatibia and Giacomo Pierantoni wrote in a note. “Retail investors are now liquidity providers rather than the marginal prices setter.”"

The more stringent measures could target potash, a soil nutrient used to improve crops, the official said, asking not to be named discussing private conversations. Potash is the country’s major export -- supplying a large share of European demand -- and its only abundant mineral resource. The EU has already sanctioned seven Belarusian entities and 88 individuals, including discredited president, Alexander Lukashenko, and was already working on adding more people to that list over their support for the regime and the repressions of protests. Following agreement between EU leaders on Monday to sanction Belarus further, that list is now expected to expand to include people involved in the Ryanair incident and should be adopted by the bloc’s foreign ministers on June 21. The EU leaders also called for the adoption of “targeted economic sanctions” and work on preparing the framework to allow for these new measures has also begun. The exact sectors to target have yet to be defined but are likely to include areas such as potash where state enterprises are most active, according to the EU official. Belarus is one of the world’s biggest exporters of potash and as such any restrictions could impact global markets. Other targets could include Belavia, the country’s national airline. Read More: Macron’s Frustration Shows Limits of EU Influence in Belarus “It makes no sense rocking Belarus,” Lukashenko told a gathering of lawmakers and officials in Minsk Wednesday. He said events around Belarus constituted “hybrid warfare,” state-owned news agency Belta said. Lukashenko defended his actions in Sunday’s Ryanair flight incident and said that Belarus will “compensate” for possible Western sanctions by going to other markets and fostering its close ties with Russia. “We’ll substitute Europe, which is growing mercilessly old, for rapidly growing Asia,” he said. The EU measures will need to name specific sectors and be clearly defined so as to withstand potential legal proceedings and win the backing of all member states. Forging unanimity between EU governments has proved tricky lately, with several countries keen to avoid hurting their economies or dent controversial political alliances. “A lot will depend of what type of sanctions are implemented,” said Elena Sakhnova, an analyst at VTB Capital. “If those are just sectoral penalties, such as limiting Belarus potash industry’s ability to get financing in European banks, this won’t cause disruption on the market as Belarus uses alternative sources of funding anyway.” More meaningful penalties would prevent European companies from trading with the Belarusian potash industry, though Belarus would still be able to divert from Europe to other markets, primarily Asia, Sakhnova said. That may cause a short-term increase in potash prices in Europe, as Belarus supplies about 25% of the region’s demand, though the situation should normalize fairly quickly, she said. Producers like Russia’s Uralkali PJSC may replace Belarusian volumes in Europe, she said. Read More: Airlines Flying Around Belarus Face Delays and Higher Fuel Cost Speaking to European parliament’s foreign affairs committee on Wednesday, exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya urged the EU to ban exports of potash, oil products and timber, as well as halting lending to Belarusian banks. Potash producer Belaruskali is one of the largest state-owned companies in Belarus. Minsk-based state-owned Belarusian Potash Co. is a trader, handling export sales of all potash produced in Belarus. “There is too much speculative information about the topic”, Belarusian Potash Co.’s press service said by email. BPC, as the company is also known, said it hopes for a “measured and reasonable” approach in the matter as potash supplies are important for food safety and agriculture industry in the countries that buy the nutrient. In addition to sanctions, some member states will be withdrawing their aviation agreements with Belarus, while governments are also discussing banning Belarusian carriers’ access to the EU, including overflights and landing rights, according to the same official."

The watchmaker will probably open more stores than it closes in the second half as the outlook improves, Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said in an interview Tuesday. Growth at its own shops recovered quickly as soon as they reopened, he said. The shares rose as much as 4.2% in morning trading. “It’s proving true that consumers like to shop even more after a crisis,” Hayek said by phone. “2021 will be a very good year, finally.” Consumers with pent-up demand for luxury goods and extra cash are returning to brick-and-mortar stores as vaccination campaigns advance. At Swatch, demand is outpacing production capacity, especially for brands like Omega and Blancpain, Hayek said. Swatch said late Monday it swung to a profit in the first half, beating analysts’ estimates, as demand in China, the U.S. and Russia was strong. Revenue in local currencies will be higher in the second half compared with the year-earlier period, the company also said Monday after markets closed. Sales amounted to 3.4 billion francs ($3.7 billion) in the six months through June, compared with 4.1 billion generated in first half two years ago. “We’re seeing an acceleration month-to-month, where we approach 2019 levels more and more or even exceed them sometimes,” Hayek said. “In July, the strong sales are continuing.” Revenue at airports and popular tourist destinations was still down, weighing especially on the Swatch brand, known for its colorful plastic designs. The timepiece is often purchased as a gift or a souvenir on vacation. Excluding tourism, the brand is growing, Hayek said. The company cut about 850 jobs in the first half as it closed 135 stores. Swatch decided not to renew expensive rent contracts and let contracts run out at locations with low traffic due to Covid, such as stores in shopping centers, Hayek said. The company also opened 36 ones during that time period. “In the U.S., China, and even in Switzerland, there are opportunities for less expensive conditions,” Hayek said.   Operating profit reached 402 million francs. Analysts expected 338 million francs. Swatch had a loss in the first half last year and cut 2,400 jobs in its biggest cull ever. “The results confirm the strong rebound seen at luxury houses,” Jean-Philippe Bertschy, an analyst at Bank Vontobel AG, wrote in a note."

U.S. Vaccine Drive Gives Airlines a Boost,"['Layan Odeh', 'Anthony Palazzo']",Business,"A powerful vaccine drive in the U.S. has pushed North America’s air-travel comeback past Asia’s for the first time since the Lunar New Year holiday in February.Airlines in the U.S. continued to gain momentum in the most recent week, based on data from flight tracker OAG. Asia, which had led all regions, lost ground as countries such as Singapore and Indonesia held back on air travel to fight a surge in coronavirus cases. The switch highlights the power of accelerating Covid-19 vaccine programs in bringing back activities like entertainment and tourism that became high risk with the onset of the crisis last year. Countries that have quickly rolled out shots are making rapid progress toward the return of flying— including in the European Union, which agreed Wednesday to reopen its borders to nations and travelers deemed safe, including from the U.S. Overall, air travel ticked up in the most recent week. Global capacity rose by one point to 58% of pre-crisis levels, based on Bloomberg’s weekly flight tracker, which uses OAG data to monitor the pulse of the comeback.  Aviation has been hit hard throughout the pandemic. The industry lost $126 billion last year and stands to bleed another $48 billion this year, based on estimates from the International Air Transport Association. Governments that slammed borders shut early on are loath to loosen up too quickly, fearful that — like India — they’ll backslide on progress fighting a disease that has now killed almost 3.4 million people.  The cautious pace of reopening means chances for a strong European bounce-back in tourism this summer are pinned partly on an extension of the peak season in July and August through September, when many tourists will have traditionally gone back to work. This year, there’s hope that pent-up demand from vaccinated masses will hold up for another month. Airlines located inside of large domestic markets such as China, the U.S. and Australia have generally fared better than those in smaller locales like the U.K., Singapore or Greece. That dynamic is starting to shift, and vaccines are the big driver. In the U.S., where 48% of the population has received at least one dose, carriers have added capacity to international destinations in the Caribbean and Latin America, fed by demand from vaccinated travelers less afraid to get on planes. Still, domestic flights make up 85% of the global total. Overall, U.S. capacity is now down less than 25% from the same week in 2019, jumping more than 7 percentage points in the past month, with the big three of  American Airlines Group Inc.,  Delta Air Lines Inc. and  United Airlines Holdings Inc., along with discount specialist  Southwest Airlines Co. and others accelerating their expansions.  JetBlue Airways Corp. said on Wednesday that it would initiate long-awaited  trans-Atlantic services from Boston and New York’s to Heathrow and Gatwick airports in London, starting from August.  “Vaccinations have really picked up,” George Michalopoulos, chief commercial officer of Hungarian discounter  Wizz Air Holdings Plc, said on the sidelines of the Arabian Travel Market event in Dubai this week. The U.S. is “two to three months ahead of Europe but that shows the path forward.”  Until Wednesday, the return of international travel in the EU has been complicated by border rules set independently by more than two dozen member countries. The decision on a coordinated reopening will likely accelerate travel once it takes effect, potentially within the next week or two. The U.S. is likely to be white-listed, meaning non-vaccinated travelers will also be let in, based on the EU guidelines and its declining rate of Covid-19 cases.  Progress was made earlier this week, when the U.K. — which has gotten jabs into 55% of its population — finally removed a legal ban on leisure escapes. Sunny Portugal, one of the few countries on Britain’s “green list,” has been the biggest beneficiary.  Greece, Italy and France have also made strides, with EU vaccine rates accelerating, and anticipation of more outside visitors. In all, airline capacity closed the gap with 2019 levels by 4.4 percentage points in the past week, the most of any region.  While vaccinations are the most important factor to a return to travel from a medical perspective, ending border restrictions will have a more-immediate impact transforming pent-up demand into ticket sales, said John Grant, chief analyst at OAG. Unilateral decisions around lockdowns ``are just damaging everyone’s confidence and frustrating airlines.’’ One key objective for U.S. and European airlines is a meaningful restart of trans-Atlantic flights. The highly profitable market was gutted last year as the virus first surged in the west. While countries such as Italy had already started to ease restrictions on Americans, the opening isn’t reciprocal. On Tuesday,  Deutsche Lufthansa AG added its voice to a growing chorus of airlines demanding decisionmakers from Washington and London to Brussels change the rules.  The German carrier said it’s adding flights to Atlanta and Orlando starting in June based on rising demand, after curbs were loosened in its home country. Meanwhile, U.S. businesses including hotel chains and car-rental firms are pushing hard for a reopening. The EU aims to lift recommended curbs on U.S. visitors as it introduces its Green Digital Certificate that should facilitate easier border checks.  Once curbs are lifted, a good portion of the trans-Atlantic market “could be back very quickly, since these routes are for many airlines amongst their most profitable and there is a large amount of pent up demand,” said OAG’s Grant. He said it may take until next year for schedules to be fully restored. One catalyst for a rebound could be a meeting of the G7 nations in Cornwall, England, from June 11 to 13, said Sean Doyle, the chief executive officer of British Airways. He said he expects Britain to be “the first country this side of the Atlantic” permitted to resume travel to U.S. for non-Americans. Air traffic in Europe still lags the rest of the developed world, but it’s begun to close the gap. The progress has been made possible by rising vaccination counts: notably in U.K., but also across the EU after a slow start. Countries in Asia feeling the sting of rising cases have responded by tightening restrictions to counter the threat of a highly transmissible coronavirus variant that first took hold in India. This week, Singapore and Hong Kong  suspended plans for a travel bubble that was set to start on May 26. While Western nations have also taken defensive measures, they’ve emphasized accelerating vaccine rollouts to protect their populations. Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan, for example, are far behind the U.S., U.K., or Israel in  per-capita inoculations."

The board voted to end the contract of CEO Jacob Schram, according to a statement Monday. He was replaced by Chief Financial Officer Geir Karlsen, who spent about six months as interim CEO in 2019. Source: Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA Karlsen is credited with leading the company’s financial reconstruction, according to the statement. Norwegian secured court approval in March for the overhaul, which saw the carrier pivot away from discount long-haul flights, restructure its balance sheet and bring in new investors. The reconstituted company is targeting the European market from its base in the Nordics. “Further efforts will be made to strengthen Norwegian´s position as a low-cost airline and to return the company to sustainable profitability,” Chairman Svein Harald Oygard said in the statement. Schram, who spent decades as an executive at fast-food, convenience-store and gas-station chains, was brought in to lead Norwegian in November 2019, when its viability was being openly questioned by rivals. At the time, the company touted his “extreme” customer focus. He is entitled to a nine-month notice period and 15 month of severance pay. The board sought to “bring the severance payments to a level reflecting the challenges of the industry, but no agreement could be reached,” the company said. Norwegian sought insolvency protection in Irish courts in November 2020, and secured court approval for the restructuring in March. The carrier was struggling even before the coronavirus crisis stunted air travel after going head-to-head with discounters including Ryanair Holdings Plc in Europe and taking on British Airways in trans-Atlantic markets. As part of the restructuring, Norwegian raised 3.73 billion kroner ($430 million) in a private placement as one of its final steps before exiting insolvency proceedings. Shares of Norwegian were up less than 1% at 9:02 a.m. in Oslo. The company has a market value of 7.3 billion kroner."

Italia Trasporto Aereo SpA, known as ITA, plans to start services on Oct. 15, after months of talks with European Commission officials over terms of the overhaul and aid previously granted to Alitalia finally produced a deal on Thursday. With those issues resolved, the company is set to kick off with mainly European flights and a handful of long-haul routes from Rome and Milan to New York, Boston, Tokyo and Miami. The goal is to build a leaner carrier that can focus mainly on international markets, without getting bogged down by the costs and commitments that made Alitalia a ward of the government since 2017. But ITA, at half the size of the old Alitalia, may be too small to compete against established airlines with only seven wide-body planes, and is lacking a partner after years of talks with major carriers including Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Delta Air Lines Inc. Long-haul travel also remains hobbled by widespread border curbs, and the corporate demand that’s usually a key driver for inter-continental journeys is expected to take years to fully revive after the 16-month global pandemic. In the short-haul markets that are rushing back, lower-cost rivals led by Ryanair Holdings Plc and fast-expanding Wizz Air Holdings Plc have moved into Italy during the pandemic while the government haggled with Brussels over what Alitalia assets could be handed over to state-owned ITA. “Uncertainties are very high in long-haul markets,” said Andrea Giuricin, transportation economist at the University of Milano-Bicocca. And ITA “will hardly will have costs as low as Wizz or Ryanair.” Ryanair, Europe’s largest discount airline, now controls 33% of the Italian market, up from 22% in mid-2019, based on data from flight-tracking firm OAG. The Irish carrier has restored almost all of its pre-pandemic capacity in Italy, while Alitalia -- a close No. 2 in summer 2019 -- has fallen by more than half. Ryanair’s new Boeing Co. 737 Max jets will carry even more people and sip less fuel, bringing expenses down further, Chief Executive Officer Micheal O’Leary said Thursday in an interview in Rome. “We know that all competitors have higher costs than we do,” he said. “We scare them; they don’t scare us.” Wizz, based in Hungary and listed in London, has tripled its presence in Italy after adding six bases since the start of last year and plans to double its fleet in the country. EasyJet Plc may represent a further threat once travel curbs in its home U.K. market are eased, while ITA will be launching just as tourism enters the typically slow winter season when even the healthiest European airlines generally lose money. State-owned Alitalia was the dominant local presence in Italy for decades. A bloated workforce, an aging fleet and inefficient operating model saddled it with high costs -- but allowing it to fail was a political nonstarter. Successive governments plowed more than 5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) into the firm after former shareholder Etihad Airways of Abu Dhabi cut ties in 2017. The EU, while allowing further funding during the pandemic, has demanded arms-length terms for the transfer of assets like the Alitalia name to ITA in order to avoid violating state-aid rules. Under terms of the deal with the EU, there’ll also be competitive tenders for non-airline activities, with ITA required to partner with other companies interested in bidding for ground handling and maintenance services. ITA, owned by the Italian Finance Ministry, will start out debt-free but will be half the size of Alitalia, with just 52 aircraft -- increasing to 78 in 2022 -- and about 2,800 staff. It will receive 700 million euros from the Treasury to begin flights, according to a statement issued after the EU agreement was reached. The new airline plans to hire up to 5,700 people, but Alitalia workers will lose salary levels and seniority, likely exacerbating labor strains that have dogged the company throughout the bankruptcy process. Chief Executive Officer Fabio Lazzerini has said an alliance with an international airline could be both commercial and industrial, meaning the partner could buy a stake. Yet Lufthansa and other potential suitors that have accepted state aid from their own governments are either barred from investing or risk a political backlash if they make such a move before paying back their rescue funding. A partnership is necessary for ITA but it won’t be enough without an investment, said Giuricin, the transportation economist. “It is more important to be part of one of the large European groups,” he said. “A standalone strategy is not an option anymore.”"

In France, officials are preparing to ease lockdown restrictions and jump-start air travel. In the U.K., workers are returning to offices in numbers not seen since the start of the pandemic as the vaccination rollout continues and cases fall. Not so in the oil sands of western Canada, where thousands of roughnecks have descended upon barracks in work camps and have turned the area, which accounts for more than half of America’s oil imports, into a hot spot for a resurgence of the pandemic. It’s the latest blow to the oil-rich province of Alberta that in the past years has struggled with two crude-market crashes, rising unemployment, plus devastating wildfires and floods. Now, the pandemic that’s led scores of restaurants and other businesses to shut in urban centers like Calgary is hitting the industry that accounts for 16% of the economy. “It’s out of control,” said Allan Adam, chief of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, an indigenous community in the region. He pegs the surge in new cases to the fly-in-fly-out nature of many jobs in the oil sands. “I am more worried about our health care system. If that collapses, then all hell breaks loose.” A slower rollout of vaccines in Canada, combined with growing outbreaks of more contagious variants, has prompted lockdowns across the country and restrictions on inter-provincial travel. Twelve oil-sands production sites have been listed for outbreaks just as contractors are flying in for maintenance season. Over 2,000 Covid-19 cases have been linked to the facilities, with 752 considered active, according to Alberta Health data. Two people have died. The latest was a woman in her 50s in a case linked to Suncor Energy Inc.’s Base Plant. Sites owned by Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Imperial Oil and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. have also seen outbreaks. The surging case numbers and hospitalizations prompted the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo in northern Alberta to declare a state of local emergency on Sunday. In the remote town of Fort McMurray, the gateway to the oil sands that was devastated by massive blazes five years ago, the Northern Lights Regional Health Center has postponed 40 elective surgeries and some ambulatory care services are being limited, Kerry Williamson, a spokeswoman for Alberta Health Services, said. More than 1.5% of Fort McMurray’s population is currently infected with coronavirus, the highest rate in Alberta, which has the highest rate in Canada, government data show. When the pandemic started last year, oil sands companies and work camp operators that housed them faced a similar situation. Employees who weren’t required at the production sites were told to work from home. Workers were spread out on the buses that transport them to and from the oil sands sites and employees took lunch breaks at different times to ensure mess halls didn’t become overcrowded. This latest wave of infections is worse. So far, oil sands companies haven’t reported any impact to production, but the outbreaks are affecting maintenance work. Suncor has postponed to June from May the shutdown for maintenance of the U2 upgrader at its Base Plant, which turns thick bitumen dug out of open-pit mines into as much oil a day as what’s produced in the entire state of Wyoming. Two other Suncor sites have also been linked to outbreaks, with a total of 166 active cases. Suncor has implemented protocols to keep workers safe and is offering rapid antigen screening to quickly detect asymptomatic individuals, keeping transmission rates “very low,” the company said by email. Syncrude Canada, which is majority-owned by Suncor, began maintenance involving 2,000 people from the local communities and around Alberta on its 350,000-barrel-a-day upgrader last month but stretched the work out over a longer-than-normal time frame to control the spread of disease, Will Gibson, a company spokesman, said. Still, there are 221 active cases of Covid-19 linked to its operations. “We have seen an increase and that reflects the increase in the wider community in Fort McMurray,” Gibson said, adding that some asymptomatic cases were detected because of rapid testing. At Canadian Natural’s Horizon upgrader, Alberta Health has been notified of 294 active cases. Maintenance work at Horizon this month should reduce production by 250,000 barrels a day, company President Tim McKay said in March. The company also has 22 cases in two other sites. The company has been “rapid testing asymptomatic staff during our Horizon maintenance period in April,” Julie Woo, a spokeswoman, said by email. “This testing is helping us to quickly identify, contact trace and limit the spread of COVID-19 at our work site.”"

A French initiative to ban commercial air travel on some domestic routes could prove to be an example for other countries seeking to make flying cleaner. The bill making its way through parliament would forbid conventional air travel when there’s an alternative by train that takes under 2.5 hours. The legislation advanced in the National Assembly over the weekend as part of a broader debate on climate legislation and still needs to go through the Senate. A TGV high speed train leaves Bordeaux for Paris. “This policy really has the potential to accelerate all sustainable aviation options,” said Venkat Viswanathan, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University. “Among them it could really push electric aviation forward.” Aviation was one of the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions before the coronavirus pandemic brought global travel to a halt. In 2019, the sector produced about 2% of man-made carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming, according to industry group ATAG. Shorter flights are among the most-polluting. While France made domestic route cutbacks a condition of aid to the French arm of Air France-KLM last year, no country has extended the measures to its broader domestic aviation market. Fossil fuels remain the least expensive option to power planes, even as cleaner alternatives are being developed. Sustainable aviation fuels are available in small volumes, battery-powered flights for fewer than 400 miles are almost ready and aviation giant Airbus SE is designing hydrogen planes that won’t be ready for more than a decade. The law states that exemptions for “decarbonized” flights will be provided in the future. That could open up a market for lower-carbon short-haul flights, creating a space for sustainable alternatives that could help bring costs down further, Viswanathan said. As it stands, the French regulation would also ban construction of new airports or extensions of existing hubs if the works would lead to an increase in emissions, although exceptions will be made in some cases for health or national security reasons, according to a statement from the environment ministry on Sunday. Airlines would be required to phase in carbon offset programs for domestic flights between 2022 and 2024. These could include reforestation or other nature protection plans. The package could still be modified as it goes through the Senate and final approval could take weeks. The U.K., which like France has passed a law to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, is pushing ahead with airport expansions. The local government recently approved the extension of a runway at Southampton Airport, despite opposition from environmental groups. Environmental groups have asked France to go further. “The proposed French travel time limit of 2.5 hours leaves a huge number of short flights still in operation,” said John Hyland, a spokesman for Greenpeace EU. “The EU and European governments, France included, should ban all domestic and cross-border short flights when passengers can use less polluting transport like rail or bus.” Jo Dardenne, aviation manager at climate group Transport & Environment, said the French government should also target long-haul flights by “mandating the use of greener jet fuel and charging an effective carbon price that forces airlines to fly cleaner.” The rules were put together after Air France was forced to abandon some short-haul routes in France as part of the 7 billion-euro ($8.3 billion) government bailout. The package requested the company to curb domestic flights by 40%. Sister carrier KLM was told by the Dutch government to halve CO2 emissions per passenger by 2030. The bill currently under discussion was designed to prevent Air France-KLM’s rivals, including low-cost competitors, from taking up those routes abandoned by the carrier’s French arm. Prior to the latest Air France-KLM bailout, European Union states had channeled at least 23 billion euros into airlines through loans, guarantees, capital injections and grants. Austria was the only other European country to put in constraints on short-haul air travel as part of its funding plan for the local unit of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, according to a bailout tracker compiled by Transport & Environment.

The Thiele family’s KB Holding GmbH sold more than half its stake in Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Europe’s biggest airline, disposing of 33 million shares at a 9.80 euros each. While that’s a 9.8% discount to the stock’s closing price the previous day, the heirs likely  broke even on the transaction given the original purchase price. The retreat comes almost exactly a year since Thiele’s multibillion euro bet on the carrier fizzled as the German government acquired a 20% stake in the airline as part of a 9 billion euro ($11 billion) coronavirus bailout, massively diluting private stockholders. Thiele fought against the bailout and hinted he might push Lufthansa toward bankruptcy by upholding his opposition, before eventually acquiescing to the terms. The family’s sale comes as Lufthansa prepares to raise about 3 billion euros in new equity to unwind some of its 9 billion-euro state bailout. Thiele died in February without having completed making arrangements that would lighten his heirs’ inheritance-tax obligations. Lufthansa fell as much as 6.6% in Frankfurt, and traded at 10.15 euros at 10:40 a.m. The stock has lost about 6% in value this year At the time of his death, Thiele’s $20.2 billion fortune made him the fourth-richest person in Germany and the 97th-wealthiest in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He built an around 12% stake in Lufthansa before he passed away at age 79. The timing of the 323 million-euro disposal means Thiele’s heirs received prices about one-third below pre-crisis levels. Still, they may have walked away without taking a hit on their investment, much of which was made in the first quarter of 2020 when Lufthansa’s stock traded as low as around 8.30 euros. Thiele’s bid to become the dominant shareholder at the airline would have given him a dominant voice at one of Germany’s most storied companies. Lufthansa connects the country’s manufacturing titans to the far-flung export markets on which Europe’s largest economy depends. Volkswagen AG and Siemens AG are its biggest corporate customers. Europe’s largest carrier has cut back on its fleet and staffing, and has recently started to pay back some of the aid. The company has investor approval for a capital increase of up to 5.5 billion euros to mend its balance sheet. Even after the disposal, the Thiele family remains the largest private shareholder in Lufthansa, after the German government, which obtained a 20% holding with the bailout last year. The family had previously cut its stake to 10.1%, according to regulatory filings. Part of the reason for the sale may be because Thiele’s heirs reportedly owe German authorities more than 5 billion euros in inheritance taxes, potentially the largest such bill in the country’s history, according to Manager Magazin. Thiele’s assets were meant to be placed in a foundation to reduce tax risks, but it wasn’t set up when he died, the magazine reported last month. Thiele built an empire spanning real estate, industrials and agriculture after starting his career in 1969 at Knorr-Bremse AG, the brake-system manufacturer he turned into a global leader and publicly listed in 2018, with KB Holding retaining almost 60%. He also built a majority holding in Vossloh AG, a German maker of railcars and train equipment."

Prime Minister Claude Joseph confirmed Haiti had requested assistance from the U.S. military to protect infrastructure and prepare for elections in an interview with the Associated Press. Officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security will travel to Port-au-Prince to assess the situation and lend support, White House Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said earlier on Friday as more details emerged about the Colombian-led hit squad implicated in the crime. Haiti’s police say they detained 19 men: 17 Colombians and two U.S. citizens of Haitian descent, and killed four. The police say 28 people were part of the hit team, allegedly led by retired Colombian soldiers, which carried out the first murder of a sitting Haitian president in more than a century. It remains unclear who ordered the attack. Moise’s assassination further destabilizes the poorest nation in the Americas, which has been gripped by gang violence, kidnappings, protests and the pandemic. It hasn’t had a functioning legislature since 2020 and the head of the Supreme Court -- who might have replaced Moise -- recently died due to Covid-19. Amid the request for assistance, Interim Prime Minister Joseph’s leadership position remains in doubt. Haiti’s senate, currently comprised of only a third of its usual members, nominated its head Joseph Lambert to be interim president, Reuters reported. Joseph said Friday that he had spoken to Colombian President Ivan Duque, who had “promised full collaboration” in resolving the crime. Colombian Defense Minister Diego Molano also acknowledged that the international police agency Interpol had made a formal request for information about the suspects. At first, the raid seemed to be meticulously planned and carried out, as the heavily-armed killers pretended to be U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents to gain access to Moise’s residence in the hills outside of Port-au-Prince. A judge who visited the scene told local media that Moise had been shot at least 12 times. Moise’s wife was also wounded, and was medically evacuated to South Florida. Read More: Recruiting Mercenaries for Middle East Fuels Rancor in Colombia But it appears their escape plan fell through. Less than 24-hours after the crime, Haiti’s police had killed a handful of suspects and rounded up others. At least two presumed mercenaries were caught by angry mobs, tied with rope and marched through the streets. Eleven others were found hiding on the grounds of the Taiwanese Embassy, near Moise’s home. On Thursday night, police presented the men, sitting on the floor with their hands bound behind their backs. They also showed a cache of automatic weapons, machetes, sledgehammers, radios and what appeared to be Colombian passports that they said had been taken from the group. Local newspaper Le Nouvelliste said officials had also recovered the hard drive that stored security footage at Moise’s residence, as well as his checkbook. One of the men Haitian police presented as an alleged member of the squad was identified as Manuel Antonio Grosso, who Colombia media said is a former paratrooper and member of the special forces. On June 6 -- a month before Moise’s assassination -- he posted pictures of himself on Facebook in neighboring Dominican Republic, which borders Haiti. Colombian troops are considered among the world’s toughest after having fought against local guerrillas in jungles and mountains for more than five decades. And many have been tempted to quit their posts to become military contractors in the Middle East and elsewhere. Prime Minister Joseph -- who had been on the job for less than three months -- is currently in charge of the nation of 11 million. The head of the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti, Helen La Lime, has said that Joseph plans to go ahead with presidential and legislative elections in September, with a second round in November. How Power Struggle in Haiti Preceded Assassination: QuickTake But Joseph’s hold on power is being challenged from several sides. Earlier this week, Moise had named Ariel Henry to fill the prime minister’s post. While he was never sworn in, Henry told a local newspaper that he -- not Joseph -- is the prime minister, but said he favored dialog to keep from “igniting” the country."

One moment, you are reading about a variant across the world, next thing you know, it’s becoming the dominant strain in the U.S.” In late June, some EU countries have permitted American tourists to visit again if they’ve been vaccinated or meet other conditions, such as testing negative for Covid.

Buttigieg acknowledged the U.S. travel protocols designed to prevent the spread of Covid-19 are “imperfect.” “We are dealing with a country-based framework for assessing risk when, in a perfect world, we would know all the information we need to have for a traveler-based framework,” he said. “We can move in that direction somewhat. That is more refined and ultimately more accurate from a risk assessment standpoint.” However, Buttigieg added, the U.S. doesn’t “have the toolkit” to do that currently and will continue to follow the strategy led by public health authorities, guided by the Department of Homeland Security, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Transportation Department “to reopen travel as quickly as we responsibly can.”"

While forward reservations for summer are stuck at 32% of 2019 levels in North America, and half of that in Europe and Asia, accelerating vaccine campaigns and an improved health-care picture mean demand can still pick up, Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association, said in his first address in the role. Johnson Says U.K. Hasn’t Given Up on Overseas Trips by May (1) “We should remain optimistic that the second half of this year will be more positive than we’ve seen so far,” said Walsh, the former chief of British Airways owner IAG SA. “The expectation of the vaccine roll-out accelerating is one of the reasons why we can be optimistic that things will start to improve.” Forward bookings for the May-to-September time frame are at just 15% of 2019 levels for Europe and 14% for Asia, with North American demand looking slightly healthier, according to figures released Wednesday by IATA. The usual surge in bookings for summer has given way to caution, as passengers wait for clarity on vaccinations and travel restrictions. Ryanair Holdings Plc, Europe’s biggest discount airline and a staple for vacationers, warned Wednesday that it would struggle to make a profit this year as setbacks fighting the virus delayed a rebound in travel. Walsh said that international traffic was down almost 89% in February and is showing no signs of recovery in the current environment. But he added that when government restrictions are relaxed or removed there is strong pent-up demand. He also saw reason to be positive on the prospect of a travel corridor between the U.K. and the U.S. “in the near future.” Such a plan has been increasingly touted as a way to reopen travel between two economies which are progressing well with vaccination campaigns, even as continental Europe struggles with a fresh wave of the virus."

Countries will be rated according to their Covid-19 risk in a traffic light system, the Department for Transport said Friday. At a minimum, travelers will need to buy a two-test package, including a so-called PCR assessment, that typically costs around 220 pounds ($300) per person and can range much higher. Covid-19 vaccinations take place in Derby, U.K., in March. “The framework announced today will help allow us to reopen travel safely and sustainably, ensure we protect our hard-won achievements on the vaccine roll-out and offer peace of mind to both passengers and industry,” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said in an emailed statement. Airline groups welcomed the progress toward a travel restart after a year of Covid-19 restrictions that walloped the industry. Still, they criticized testing requirements they said would put family vacations out of reach for many. Tim Alderslade, chief executive officer of the industry body Airlines UK, called the proposals a “further setback for an industry on its knees.” The U.K.’s fast vaccine rollout has driven down cases and given the travel industry its best shot at taking advantage of the summer high season. But without a clear date to restart non-essential travel, airlines remain unable to confidently schedule flights, staff and aircraft requirements. The government has said that May 17 is the earliest day foreign holidays can resume, but officials have warned that a further delay could be required if coronavirus infections continue to surge elsewhere in the world. Different testing and quarantine regimes will be compulsory according to whether a destination is rated green, amber or red, the department said. It’s still too early to say which nations will fall in each category, with a decision coming in early May on that matter and whether the May 17 target can be met. Shapps defended the need for PCR tests that can identify Covid-19 variants and said he’ll look for ways to keep the costs down. “I’m going to work with the travel industry and the private testing providers to drive down that cost,” he said in an interview on BBC Radio 4. “I won’t spare those companies who seem to be profiteering, including potentially removing them from the recommended list.” Under the new system British residents going on holiday abroad will be required to purchase Covid-19 testing packages and quarantine packages from approved providers, prior to departure, depending on the traffic light rating of their destination. Countries in the safest, “green” category that are in danger of being elevated to amber will be placed on a public watch list so that travelers have advanced warning of a possible change in rating and can plan accordingly. The industry took particular aim at the decision to require a PCR test, which is more accurate but much more expensive, upon return to the U.K. Lateral flow tests cost as little as 5 pounds. “This does not represent a reopening of travel as promised by ministers,” Alderslade said. “The insistence on expensive and unnecessary PCR testing rather than rapid testing – even for low-risk countries – will pose an unsustainable burden on passengers, making travel unviable and unaffordable for many people.” In an interview with Sky News, Shapps said he’ll seek innovative ways to lower the testing costs. For example, he said the U.K. might help to provide the faster and cheaper lateral-flow tests people must take before they leave other countries to return to the U.K. The government will also look for ways to lower the expense of testing when they return home from countries in the green category, he said. The U.K. wants to get to a point where travelers can take lateral-flow tests with them in their suitcases so they can take one before their return, Shapps said. At the moment, the requirement for PCR testing when they get home is “an abundance of caution.” Countries will be categorized based on factors including the percentage of their population that have been vaccinated, the rate of infection, the prevalence of Coronavirus “variants of concern” and the destination’s “access to reliable scientific data and genomic sequencing,” the department said. Restrictions will be formally reviewed on June 28, with further reviews no later than July 31 and Oct. 1. While Britain said in February that its rapid vaccination roll-out could allow a resumption of travel as early as May 17, a new wave of Covid-19 outbreaks in mainland Europe has put that target at risk. A second summer lost to the coronavirus crisis would likely trigger a spate of airline failures and bankruptcy filings, alongside a repeat of 2020’s bailouts, job cuts, and jetliner deferrals and cancellations, according to consultants IBA Group. “As it stands, a meaningful restart of aviation is not yet possible under the new system,” Karen Dee, CEO of the Airport Operators Association, said in a statement. “This puts the government’s Global Britain agenda and more than a million jobs supported by aviation and tourism at risk.” Pre-departure Covid-19 test for those traveling back to the U.K. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test on or before day 2 of arrival back in the U.K. No need to quarantine unless test is positive Pre-departure Covid-19 test for those traveling back to the U.K. Arrivals need to quarantine at home for 10 days PCR test on days 2 and 8 of arrival back in the U.K., with an option for a test on day 5 to secure early release from quarantine Pre-departure Covid-19 test for those traveling back to the U.K. 10-day stay in a managed quarantine hotel PCR test on days 2 and 8 of arrival back in the U.K."

Governor Brad Little returned home to Idaho to “clean up a mess” he said was caused by Janice McGeachin, his lieutenant governor. McGeachin, who is seeking to become governor herself, had a day earlier issued an executive order while Little was out of town repealing almost all local mask mandates, including in public schools. Idaho has never had a statewide mask mandate.  “The action that took place was an irresponsible, self-serving political stunt,” Little said of the order by his fellow Republican, which he repealed. “Taking the earliest opportunity to act solitarily on a highly politicized, polarizing issue without conferring with local jurisdictions, legislators, and the sitting governor is, simply put, an abuse of power.” “This kind of over-the-top executive action amounts to tyranny,” he added.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has loosened its guidance for summer camps, announcing Friday that fully vaccinated campers will no longer need to wear masks or practice social distancing. For those who are not fully vaccinated for Covid-19, mask wearing is especially important indoors and in crowded outdoor settings, where physical distancing cannot be maintained, the guidance says. The Netherlands is speeding up its reopening plan as cases and hospital admissions continue to fall. Museums, theaters and cinemas can reopen from June 5, four days earlier than planned, Prime Minister Mark Rutte said during a press briefing in the Hague on Friday. The Dutch government announced on Thursday it plans to spend an additional six billion euros on aid for companies impacted by the pandemic, bringing the total amount earmarked for businesses to 80 billion euros. Ireland will continue easing virus restrictions next month, Prime Minister Micheal Martin said. Hotels can reopen from June 2 as scheduled while outdoor dining can resume on June 7. Cinemas and theaters will reopen and as many as 200 people will be able to attend outdoor events. Ireland will adopt use of the EU digital travel certificate from July 19 and “broadly” follow EU rules for travel from Great Britain and the U.S., effectively allowing international travel to resume. The World Health Organization is finalizing its assessment of China’s Sinovac shot after it asked for further clarifications on the data provided, according to Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant director-general for drug access, vaccines and pharmaceuticals. The expert group will meet June 1 for a decision, Simao said. The WHO approved China’s Sinopharm vaccine for emergency use earlier this month. Burkina Faso is set to receive the first shipment of vaccines this Sunday more than six months since the first roll out of a global vaccination campaign. The West African nation will receive AstraZeneca doses from Covax, an initiative to distribute vaccines to poorer countries, according to a statement from the Ministry of Health. Africa remains the world’s least-inoculated continent with only 2% of vaccine doses available globally delivered here. Burundi, Tanzania and Eritrea are among countries that have so far rejected the World Health Organization’s advice to register for Covax, with some officials downplaying the impact of Covid-19 and effectiveness of the vaccines. Employers can offer bonuses and other incentives to encourage employees to get the Covid-19 vaccine, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said in updated guidance addressing a legal gray area during the pandemic. “Federal EEO laws do not prevent or limit employers from offering incentives to employees to voluntarily provide documentation or other confirmation of vaccination obtained from a third party (not the employer) in the community, such as a pharmacy, personal health care provider, or public clinic,” the agency said Friday. New York City passed a milestone in the outbreak’s easing, as the seven-day average for positive tests fell below 1% for the first time this year. “All of our #COVID19 milestones are trending in the right direction, and this makes me hopeful,” Health Commissioner Dave A. Chokshi tweeted on Friday morning. The statewide positive test rate, also averaged over seven days, has fallen to 0.76%, the lowest since Aug. 29, Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement Friday. That’s one of the lowest in the U.S. The U.K. reported 4,182 more cases on May 28, the first time the reported figure has been over 4,000 since April 1, government data show. On Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that the plan to end England’s pandemic restrictions on June 21 is hanging “in the balance,” with the more-transmissible virus variant first found in India now making up as many as three-quarters of all new cases. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in an interview with ABC that the U.S. is taking a “very close look” at vaccine passports for international travel. The White House has regularly dismissed any suggestion that it would create some federal document certifying vaccination status. Liza Acevedo, a spokesperson for the department, said later that Mayorkas was referring to work already underway to make sure “all U.S. travelers will be able to easily meet any anticipated foreign country entry requirements.” The majority of Ontario residents should be fully vaccinated by the end of the summer if they choose, provincial health officials confirmed Friday. The priority continues to be targeting those who require first dose, including hard to reach populations. Students over age 12 should be fully vaccinated by September. European regulators cleared Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s vaccine for children ages 12 and up, preparing the way for the mass vaccination of younger teenagers across the continent. The European Medicines Agency is expanding authorization of the shot, which is already cleared for people as young as 16, it said in a statement. The green light gives Europe, whose vaccine rollout was initially fraught with difficulties, the first vaccine in its arsenal for the inoculation of younger children. Senior executives at Hong Kong licensed firms are exempt from mandatory quarantine rules in the city, the Securities and Futures Commission said Friday. Relaxed rules apply to senior staff who are vaccinated and also extends to staff members at affiliates of Hong Kong licensed firms, according to statement. Rwanda will resume its vaccination campaign after receiving 247,000 AstraZeneca Plc doses through the Covax facility and a donation from France. The announcement from the health ministry follows a visit by France President Emmanuel Macron to the East African nation this week to help mend relations between the two countries. Rwanda was one of the first nations in Africa to start inoculations and has so far given out 350,400 doses of AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines. China says it saw only 119 cases of adverse events for every million doses of vaccines administered -- a rate that’s much lower than that reported for some western vaccines, although there’s little information on how the incidents were tracked, categorized and collated in the Asian country. The Malaysian government announced a two-week nationwide lockdown, which will begin June 1 as cases continued to breach daily records. Only essential economic and services sectors will be allowed to operate, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement on Friday. The government will consider aid packages for companies and people affected by the lockdown, which will last till June 14. German Chancellor Angela Merkel reiterated that waiving vaccine patents during the pandemic is not the right answer and companies need to be encouraged to invest in developing new drugs. “We are talking about sensitive products and we have to make sure the quality assurance remains,” Merkel said during Q&A at a virtual Global Solutions Summit. The U.K. cleared a vaccine for use from Johnson & Johnson, the first single-dose shot to be authorized in Britain. The country’s drug regulator gave the green light for the vaccine, the Department of Health and Social Care said Friday in a statement. The authorization gives Britain a fourth shot in its arsenal, though its use may be initially limited given more than half the population has already received one vaccine dose. Austria will remove further restrictions from June 10 amid a decline in cases and growing inoculations. Restaurants will be allowed to serve larger groups while sport and cultural events will be held with a higher, 75% limit on spectator capacity, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz told reporters Friday. Participation in social events will still require either a negative test, proof of vaccination or having recovered from the virus. The cabinet pledged further easing measures from July, including allowing weddings and larger festivities. More than 3.5 million people, or 46% of eligible, have received at least a first vaccine dose in Austria. European regulators cleared Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s vaccine for children ages 12 and up. The U.K. approved a vaccine from Johnson & Johnson.

CureVac NV said a late-stage trial of its Covid-19 vaccine will continue after passing its first interim safety analysis. The study has recorded 59 confirmed Covid cases, the company said in a statement. The trial of about 40,000 people in 10 countries will continue to collect data to conduct a statistically significant analysis of the vaccine’s efficacy, CureVac said Friday. CureVac is developing an mRNA vaccine that’s given in two doses. A monitoring board determined there were no safety concerns, according to the statement. Governor Andrew Cuomo chose an additional 10 sites where people who get a vaccine will also get a scratch-off lottery ticket with a maximum prize of $5 million. He said there was “significant interest” in the first round of prizes announced a week ago. New York is one of several states, including Ohio, Maryland and Oregon, offering lottery winnings as a vaccine incentive.

The shares dropped over 15% in early trading Monday, the steepest decline on record. They were down 11% at 2:12 p.m. in Tokyo. The stock has plunged more than 50% this year. “Much is still unclear” about the airline’s plans, said Kotaro Toriumi, an independent analyst. The company hasn’t said when it aims to return to the black and “will need to clarify how much it will cut labor costs,” including bonuses, he said. Japan Airlines, which is seeking to weather the pandemic without any job cuts, will use the proceeds to repay debt and invest in a restructuring plan for the post-pandemic era, it said in a statement Friday. As part of the plan, Japan Airlines will bolster the low-cost carrier business and buy Airbus A350s, which are more fuel-efficient than older aircraft. The coronavirus has crippled global aviation, with total industry revenue in 2021 expected to plunge by nearly a half from $838 billion last year, according to the International Air Transport Association. Japan Airlines and ANA Holdings Inc., Japan’s largest carrier, are suffering from a steep drop in domestic and international passenger traffic. Japan Airlines will issue as many as 100 million new shares, about a third of its current shares outstanding. The equity fundraising will be positive for its credit, said Toshiyasu Ohashi, chief credit analyst at Daiwa Securities. Japan Airlines will sell 30% of the shares overseas and the rest domestically, and it will offer them at a 3% to 6% discount. The issue price will be determined as early as Nov. 18. “The market was not expecting the share sale and resulting steep dilution at this point in time, since JAL still had sufficient liquidity,” said James Teo, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. While Japan Airlines said it would cut capital expenditure including aircraft spending, it plans to use a large part of the proceeds for the A350 fleet, which could be another reason for the negative market reaction, Teo said. “Widebody aircraft are meant for international routes that might remain depressed in a post-Covid era,” he said. Japan Airlines last month forecast a net loss of 240 billion to 270 billion yen for the fiscal year through March, falling into the red for the first time since emerging from bankruptcy in 2012."

Tickets for everything from domestic flights to theme parks are rapidly selling out in China ahead of its Labor Day holiday as the nation’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic gathers pace. Women from the Bai ethnic group braid tourists’ hair in Yunnan province on April 25. Bookings for seats on planes, hotel rooms and car rentals over the five-day break starting Saturday have all surged, surpassing those for the same period in 2019, according to Trip.com Group Co. People will make an estimated 200 million overall trips, a record for the national holiday, and tickets for Shanghai Disneyland have also sold out for most days. China’s early success in tackling the pandemic has helped to underpin its economic rebound, and while the Asian nation has had the odd virus flare-up around other holidays this year, its ability to contain sporadic outbreaks has given millions of people the confidence to stick to their domestic travel plans. Congestion on the nation’s highways is expected to be 10% higher than the same Labor Day holiday period in 2020, according to estimates by map service company AutoNavi. Saturday is projected to be the busiest day of the break, with a record volume of traffic on China’s roads. Bookings for seats on planes, hotels and car rentals were up 23%, 43% and 126%, respectively, compared with same period in 2019, according to estimates from Trip.com on April 14. Online tickets for the Palace Museum in Beijing were all sold out, while those for Shanghai Disneyland were only available on one of the five days as of Thursday, according to its Wechat ticketing system. The desire to travel over the holiday is forcing some to make alternative plans after missing out on tickets. Victor Li, a 32-year-old investment manager, has decided to drive to Taiyuan from Beijing to visit his family after train seats sold out. The trip will take seven hours by car, compared with three by rail. See also: Oil Bulls Buoyed by Chinese Traffic Jams and Busy Factories Railway ticketing service 12306 had sold 3.15 million tickets for the first day of the holiday two weeks ahead of time, according to a CCTV report, with people posting screen-shots of the app freezing on social media platform Sina Weibo due to the high demand. The average price of plane tickets have also doubled compared with 2019 to 1,050 yuan ($162), according to a report by China Tourism Newspaper, which is run by Ministry of Culture and Tourism. The pick-up in consumption is flowing through to China’s oil sector, which has remained a bright spot for the market as other regions grapple with a virus resurgence. The Labor Day holiday will return the country’s demand fully back to normal, said Yuntao Liu, an analyst with London-based Energy Aspects. Strong gasoline consumption has helped to underpin a boost in refining margins for the nation’s independent processors to 500 to 600 yuan per ton, the most since September, said Wang Luqing, an analyst with industry consultant SCI99. That’s prompted some to delay or cancel planned maintenance, Wang said. Wholesale gasoline prices have climbed to the highest since September 2019, while diesel is near the strongest since February 2020, according to government data. Crude stockpiles are also draining at ports in Shandong province where most Chinese private refiners reside, dropping to the lowest level in eleven weeks through April 23, figures from SCI99 show. “This five-day holiday will fully release the suppressed demand for air travel,” Shang Kejia, an official with the Civil Aviation Administration of China, said at a monthly briefing on April 16. “The Labor Day Golden Week is a good time to travel all over the country.”"

Corporate travel is poised to recover to 60% of 2019 levels by September, up from 40% in June and 20% in March, Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said as Delta reported a narrower-than-expected loss Wednesday. The coming rebound in business flying echoes the earlier gains in leisure trips, which have “fully recovered,” Delta said in a statement. Ed Bastian at a mass Covid-19 vaccination site in the Delta Flight Museum. “It’s accelerating just like we saw in the U.S. with consumers,” Bastian said in an interview. The company expects to be “solidly profitable” in the third and fourth quarters, he said. Delta and its rivals are bracing for a crucial test as they try to return to profitability without relying on billions of dollars in U.S. government aid to weather the Covid-19 pandemic. The hoped-for return of corporate customers in the second half is particularly important for Delta, which got half of its 2019 passenger revenue from business travel. “Domestic leisure traffic has fully recovered, and there are green shoots for business and international,” Conor Cunningham, an analyst with MKM Partners, said in a note. “The biggest focus from investors for Delta is on post Labor Day trends and the corporate recovery.” Delta rose less than 1% to $41.67 at 9:35 a.m. in New York. The shares climbed 2.8% this year through Tuesday, by far the the smallest gain in the S&P 500 Airlines Index, which advanced 10%. Bastian and his colleagues will discuss the outlook with financial analysts on a conference call at 10 a.m. New York time. Delta is the first major U.S. carrier to post second-quarter results, with United Airlines Holdings Inc., American Airlines Group Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. scheduled to follow next week. In the second quarter, Delta’s adjusted loss narrowed to $1.07 a share, better than the $1.42 average loss expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Adjusted revenue of $6.35 billion slightly surpassed analyst estimates. Sales were several times the level a year earlier, in the depths of the pandemic, but still about half what the figure was in 2019. The 11 largest U.S.-based carriers will report a $4.9 billion operating loss for the second quarter, compared with a shortfall of $11.8 billion in the first, Deutsche Bank AG analyst Michael Linenberg estimated in a report Tuesday. Including a $1.5 billion benefit from federal aid and other special items, Delta reported net pretax income of $776 million, or $1.02 a share. American on Tuesday forecast a “slight” second quarter profit, but also only after including bailout funds. On an adjusted basis, analysts expect Delta to post earnings of 30 cents a share in the current quarter, and 72 cents in the fourth, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A Delta survey of its biggest corporate clients showed that about 95% will have their offices open before the end of the year, Bastian said, adding that he expects many will return after Labor Day in early September. Businesses plan to return to as much as 90% of pre-Covid travel levels, he said. “Then when international markets are open, particularly European markets to the U.S., that’s another big piece of demand,” he said. “As those markets open, we’re going to see significant growth in business travel.” Still, the timing remains uncertain, with the U.S. saying it’s not ready to lift restrictions on incoming international passengers and some other countries retaining quarantine requirements or other travel limits. The U.S. requires a negative Covid test for anyone traveling into the country, and still prohibits entry from a number of other nations, including the U.K., Ireland and more than two dozen European countries."

The airline scrubbed about 14% of its scheduled flights and delayed another 28%, according to flight tracker FlightAware as of mid-afternoon Tuesday. Travelers took to Twitter to complain about long lines at airports and jetliners sitting on the tarmac, and the Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop in coordination with the carrier. “Southwest is in the process of resuming normal operations after a brief pause in our flight activity resulting from intermittent performance issues with our network connectivity Tuesday afternoon,” the company said in a statement. “We’ve canceled roughly 500 flights today. We also don’t have any reason to believe this is related to a cyber threat.” An earlier glitch at a weather-data provider late Monday forced the carrier to temporarily ground all operations and led to “a handful of cancellations and a small number of lingering delays,” the Dallas-based airline said. It wasn’t clear if the two disruptions were related. Airports have been jammed with travelers since the Memorial Day holiday last month, as customers flock back to the airlines after staying close to home for more than a year during the coronavirus pandemic. Southwest’s planes were 84% full on average in May, and the carrier has said it expects to hit 85% this month and next. Commercial flights collapsed because of Covid-19 last year, and U.S. business travel remains at only about a third of 2019 levels."

The busiest days next month will have about 4,000 flights, up from 2,300 in June, said Vasu Raja, American’s senior vice president of network strategy. The July figure is equivalent to 40% of capacity a year earlier, compared with 30% in June, the airline said Thursday. Capacity was even less in May, after a devastating collapse in flying spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic."

Reluctance to get vaccinated, particularly among Republican men, is one of the biggest risks to virus control efforts, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser said. Brazil may be getting a new health minister just as the coronavirus outbreak reaches a new peak in the country. President Jair Bolsonaro is being pressured to replace Eduardo Pazuello and find solutions to the explosion of the pandemic and the slow vaccination campaign, the sources said. Pazuello has asked to step down due to personal health issues, O Globo newspaper reported. In the six months he’s been in charge, the pandemic has unrelentingly worsened in Latin America’s largest economy. His exit would come less than a week after Brazil surpassed the milestone of 2,000 Covid-19 deaths in a single day. There’s reason to be “concerned” about the virus trends in New York City, more so than many other parts of the country, former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb said. The New York variant, along with the B.1.1.7 variant first discovered in the U.K., is pushing cases back up in one of the original Covid-19 epicenters in the U.S., Gottlieb said on CBS. On a positive note, Europe -- where infections are rising once more in several countries -- is no longer a bellwether of Covid spread in the U.S., he said, because of the level of prior infections in the US “and the fact that we’re vaccinating aggressively.” “We’re in a different situation than Europe because of the vaccine induced immunity that we’re getting into the population,” he said. AstraZeneca Plc said a “careful” review of all available data of the more than 17 million people in the European Union and the U.K. it has vaccinated against so far against Covid-19 shows no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or thrombocytopenia. The company says it is continually monitoring the safety of its vaccine. Ireland’s top official says it’s “too early to say” if the U.S. ban on most travel from Europe will be lifted this summer. Europe has a “significant journey still to go” on its coronavirus vaccines and on tamping down the more transmissible U.K. variant, Prime Minister Michael Martin said on CBS. “As the vaccination program rolls out, I believe opportunities will arise, but it’s just far too early to say yet,” he said. France won’t halt AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccines’ use, Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Twitch, Amazon’s social media, saying health authorities don’t have evidence of the drugs potential risks. Austria, Denmark, Italy and Norway suspended the use of the vaccines amid concerns of side effect while The World Health Organization called for immunizations with it. About 2,000 people protested against the Netherlands’ virus restrictions as the nation heads into general elections, the Associated Press reported. Police encircled a park in The Hague where the large demonstration gathered. One protester carried a set of stocks with Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s head inside with a sign saying: “If you love the Netherlands, vote them out.” Protesters have gathered in recent weeks in Amsterdam as patience wears thin with the restrictions, which have shuttered bars, restaurants and other businesses since October. Support for the Czech Republic’s billionaire prime minister plunged to a record low as his minority government struggles to contain one of the world’s worst coronavirus crisis before October elections. Andrej Babis’s ANO party would get 20.5% if the ballot was held now, finishing second behind the opposition Pirate Party with 22%, according to an opinion poll conducted by Kantar CZ for the public television and released Sunday. German budget airlines Eurowings is planning 300 additional flights to Mallorca around the Easter holidays, according to a press release, after Germany’s Robert Koch Institute removed the island from its list of high-risk regions. With travelers able to return home without mandatory quarantines and testing, Eurowings said it saw a “sudden onslaught of customers” and decided to make additional flights available starting March 18 at airports across the country. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio blamed Governor Andrew Cuomo for the city’s shortage of vaccines, saying people from “the suburbs, surrounding states” are permitted to get inoculated there. The mayor said the city and New York’s other municipalities need more local control over vaccine distribution, another reason he said Cuomo should resign. De Blasio, long an adversary of the governor, has already called for Cuomo to step down over allegations of sexual misconduct and covering up the number of people who died in nursing homes. “He should resign right now,” the mayor said on “Face the Nation.” A teacher in the Piedmont region of Italy died after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine, causing the region to halt giving further doses as a precaution. The region resumed Astra inoculations after isolating the batch given to the teacher. Italy is among roughly a dozen countries that have curbed the use of the vaccine over concerns about possible side effects. Europe’s vaccine production will meet targets as increased supplies from Pfizer offset any shortages in AstraZeneca shots, EU Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton said on Europe 1 radio. Details on a proposed vaccine certificate will be presented on March 17, he said. French Industry Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher said the plan has to “homogeneous” across the bloc and members must agree on the purpose of the document. France is preparing to move about 100 ICU patients from Paris to other less-hit regions, as authorities seek to avoid emergency units from being overrun. Reluctance among certain parts of the U.S. population to receiving a vaccine is one of the biggest risks to coronavirus control efforts, said Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser. His comments came when he was asked about polling showing many Republicans, especially men, don’t want a vaccine. He continued to warn against becoming complacent in the U.S. even as cases and hospitalizations drop sharply and the pace of vaccinations accelerates Duke University put its undergraduates on a one-week lockdown early Sunday after the worst outbreak “by far” since the start of the pandemic. It said that 180 students at the university in Durham, North Carolina, tested positive and another 200 were in quarantine. The university said the spread was driven largely by “recruitment parties” by fraternities and sororities. All classes for the school’s more than 6,000 undergraduates will be remote. Students living on campus will not be allowed to leave their residences except for essential activities, and off-campus students will largely be barred from university grounds. New U.S. Covid-19 cases declined by almost 100,000 last week to the fewest since early October, while an average of 1,326 people died of the disease each day, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg show. The week’s death toll of 9,284 was the lowest since mid-November. U.S. immunization has expanded amid a growing supply of vaccines and a drive by President Joe Biden’s administration to help roll them out. The U.S. vaccination rate over the last week was about 2.5 million doses per day, enough to cover 75% of the population with a two-dose shot in an estimated five months, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. Polish Deputy Prime Minister Jaroslaw Gowin said Sunday he contracted the virus. The country registered 38,308 new cases over the weekend, with the death toll rising by 453 to 47,178. The nation this week expanded restrictions to two more regions, including the capital. The curbs, starting on March 15, include limiting operations of shopping malls, hotels and cinemas. Irish authorities recommended use of the AstraZeneca vaccine be halted temporarily, amid reports of “serious blood clotting events” from the Norwegian Medicines Agency, though there’s no conclusion of a link between the vaccine and the cases. The suspension has not been formally implemented yet, but the government has always followed its advisors’ recommendations up to now. Germany reported 10,568 new virus cases, down from about 12,700 a day earlier. State health ministers spoke out against delivery shortages of the AstraZeneca vaccine over the weekend amid concerns that it will further delay the country’s vaccination campaign. Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine will start being distributed in Europe from late April, with 200 million doses reaching the EU by the end of summer, Scientific Director Paul Stoffels told Le Journal du Dimanche. The company is teaming with other laboratories to produce its vaccine, including Sanofi Pasteur in France, he said. Some 5.1 million people have received at least one vaccine dose so far in France, Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Saturday, and the government targets 10 million by mid-April. Covid-19 deaths reached 90,315 as of Saturday, up by 174 from the previous day. The number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care reached a record high 1,005 people, data released Sunday show. It’s impossible to say when Hungary will be able to ease lockdown measures and may need another pandemic plan if a new virus strain appears, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in an interview on state radio station Kossuth. AstraZeneca Plc said a “careful” review of data from more than 17 million people vaccinated shows no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism or blood clotting. Ireland’s health minister recommended temporarily suspending use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, as a growing number of countries halt shots over safety fears. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio blamed Governor Andrew Cuomo for the city’s shortage of vaccines, saying people from “the suburbs, surrounding states” are permitted to get inoculated there.

The output is accelerating many times faster than from sectors such as energy and agriculture, contributing to global warming.  Paul Eremenko,  a 41-old former chief technology officer for Airbus SE and United Technologies Corp., thinks he has a solution: hydrogen-powered airplanes. He well understands, of course, that his idea has a bit of a public relations problem right from the start. Hydrogen power and flight conjures up visions of the flaming Hindenburg airship.  His plan is to start the transition with a better way to transport hydrogen and store it in the airplane, like a gas tank in a car. Using hydrogen-powered fuel cells for aircraft isn’t a new idea. NASA already does and manufacturers have experimented for years with running small planes on them. But to become a viable business, planes would require a hydrogen fueling infrastructure that does not exist now – the same problem that has held back fuel-cell cars. Airports accustomed to loading planes with jet fuel lack the hydrogen pipelines and storage facilities to make that vision work. So Eremenko’s startup, called Universal Hydrogen Co., has developed Kevlar-coated, pill-shaped pods — about 7 feet in length and 3 in diameter — filled with hydrogen. The pods are designed to double as a storage container for transporting the hydrogen, by truck, train or other means, and a gas tank when loaded into a plane. If filled with water, each would hold about 208 gallons, and they can be stacked in racks so that 54 would fit inside a standard freight shipping container. They can even be loaded into a plane with a forklift, he said. The point is that airports wouldn’t need pipelines or underground tanks. ``We want to basically turn hydrogen into dry freight,’’ said Eremenko. He and other founders have poured about $3 million into the startup.  Universal Hydrogen has no interest in becoming an aircraft maker itself. Instead, starting in 2024, the company plans to offer not just the pods but a retrofit kit for converting a 50-seat, single-aisle, regional aircraft to run on fuel cells (although making room for the capsules would mean the planes would only have 40 seats after the switch). The converted planes would exist largely to show the industry how to make this future work. He wants the planes in the air before Boeing Co. and Airbus decide on designs for replacing their own single-aisle planes, expected to happen in the next decade. Although Universal Hydrogen will focus on planes with hydrogen fuel cells, the same pods could also one day be used to power planes that burn hydrogen in jet engines. ``There is fundamentally an incrementalist mindset in the incumbents,’’ Eremenko said. ``Hydrogen is a fairly drastic step for the industry. I think it’s a necessary step, given the industry has no other way to meet the goals of the Paris agreement.’’ Air travel accounts for roughly 2.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and before the pandemic at least, it was steadily growing. While some engineers are developing small electrified aircraft, current batteries are too heavy to power commercial planes on their own. Airlines have run highly publicized flights on biofuel blends, but Eremenko considers biofuels a stopgap measure, even if they achieve mass production. ``You’re still burning hydrocarbons at altitude, with soot and aerosols,’’ he said. Provided the hydrogen is generated from water by electrolysis using renewable power, it can be carbon-free. “Flight shaming” – the avoidance of airline travel due to its carbon footprint and the shaming of people who fly – would become a thing of the past. Hydrogen has its own challenges to overcome in the air, of course. Ever since the Hindenburg burst into flames while docking in 1937, part of the public has viewed hydrogen warily. But its proponents, including companies that have explored hydrogen for powering cars as well as airplanes, consider that fear overblown. As countless plane and car crashes have shown, conventional fuels can be quite explosive on their own. And because it is so light, hydrogen rises when accidentally released, rather than pooling as jet fuel does. Eremenko considers it safer than jet fuel and believes the public, growing used to hydrogen-powered buses and cars that are already on the road, will get over its aversion. Tom Enders, a former Airbus chief executive officer who is advising the startup, said the main market would be for medium-range, single-aisle aircraft, which account for the vast majority of aircraft worldwide. “In other words, there is a huge market potential,’’ he said in an email. “Both big aircraft manufacturers will start the development of a new single-aisle plane in the coming decade and, hence, could incorporate the structural requirements for hydrogen fuel in their respective new designs.'' Eremenko formed the startup with other aviation veterans after leaving United Technologies last year. To reach production, he estimated Universal Hydrogen will need to raise about $300 million. The same hydrogen storage solution, if successful in aviation, could one day be used in other industries, he said. Cargo ship builders are also exploring fuel cells as a future power source. But Eremenko prefers to start with planes. ``Ultimately, we think aviation is the killer app, because aviation doesn’t have an alternative,’’ he said. ``Also, it’s fun for us, because we’re aviation people.’’"
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-24/qantas-pushes-backs-expected-restart-of-international-travel,2021-02-24T21:34:55.914Z,Qantas Pushes Back Expected Restart of International Travel,['Angus Whitley'],Business,"Qantas Airways Ltd. laid out an ambitious plan to resume almost all international flights from late October, betting that vaccine rollouts will help revive the world’s shattered travel industry. Qantas aims to restart 22 of its 25 overseas routes to cities including Los Angeles, London and Johannesburg from Oct. 31, it said Thursday. Low-cost arm Jetstar will restart all its 13 international routes at the same time. The planned resumption of global travel is four months later than Qantas anticipated last year, though it broadly aligns with the date by which Australia plans to complete its vaccination program. The U.K., further ahead with its jabs, is aiming for international trips to restart as soon as May. “The vaccine changes everything,” Qantas Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said. “With the vaccine rollout already underway, we’re on the right track.” Qantas shares jumped as much as 5.2% before trading up 2.4% at A$5.13 at 2:51 p.m. in Sydney trading. Like airlines worldwide, Qantas’s attempts to fly even limited schedules have been repeatedly stymied by snap border closures, inside Australia and overseas. The airline’s revenue losses to the pandemic in 2020 were about A$11 billion ($8.8 billion) -- more than half its normal annual sales, Joyce said. The industry’s previous hopes for a vaccine-inspired travel recovery were dashed late last year as super-infectious coronavirus variants triggered tougher quarantines for passengers. So far, the aviation industry’s proposal for test or vaccine certificates to replace mandatory isolations hasn’t gained broad traction with governments. Qantas plans a “material increase” in flights in the Australia-New Zealand travel corridor from July. But the airline needs the Australian government to fully open the country’s international border before it can freely fly offshore. Initial capacity on international flights in October will be limited, and a full overseas recovery isn’t expected until 2024, Qantas said. All the same, Joyce is hoping to trigger a flurry of ticket sales by giving a firm date for flights to resume. “It’s our best estimate at the moment,” he said. “We think that October date is sensible, and hopefully conservative.” In the UK., EasyJet Plc ticket sales more than quadrupled in the hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week that international trips may restart as soon as May 17. Qantas is cutting at least 8,500 jobs and scything costs as part of a three-year plan to survive aviation’s biggest-ever crisis. Some 7,500 other workers will remain stood down until borders reopen, Joyce said Thursday. Covid-19 travel restrictions drove Qantas to an underlying pretax loss of A$1.03 billion in the six months ended December from a profit of A$771 million a year earlier. The airline’s domestic network -- long the company’s profit engine -- should reach 60% capacity this quarter and 80% in the following three months, Qantas said. Joyce’s turnaround plan involves cutting A$15 billion in costs over three years. The airline has grounded its entire fleet of 12 giant Airbus A380s for at least three years, and has deferred a backlog of other aircraft deliveries."

Two related firms, Sunwing Airlines Inc. and Sunwing Vacations Inc., will receive a combined C$375 million ($292 million) under a federal loan facility aimed at large employers, a government agency said Monday. The Sunwing companies have nearly 3,000 Canadian employees, the agency said in a statement. The announcement comes three days after Trudeau introduced sweeping new restrictions on international travel, including a suspension of flights to the Caribbean and Mexico for three months. Travelers coming into Canada will now be tested on arrival and will have to quarantine at designated hotels, at their own expense, for as long as three days to await results. Those new measures add to existing requirements that include evidence of a negative test before boarding the flight and 14-day quarantine after arrival. They also brought a new urgency to talks with airlines on financial aid that officially started in November, but had shown few outward signs of progress until now. Sunwing agreed to a number of conditions as part of the loan from the Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility, known as LEEFF. It will maintain a separate account to hold money from customers whose trips were canceled because of the pandemic, until the government and the airline industry establish a policy on refunds and credits of prepaid amounts. Companies dipping into LEEFF money also agree to make “reasonable commercial efforts” to minimize job cuts and to place restrictions on dividends, share buybacks and executive pay."

While not out of the woods just yet, Qantas said Thursday it expects revenue from routes within Australia to almost double in the six months through June from the second half of last year. The airline and its low-cost unit Jetstar have added 38 routes since July to cater to people jetting around the essentially Covid-free country while international travel remains off limits. Singapore Airlines doesn’t have the luxury of a home market, let alone a giant one like Australia. Even a sliver of potential revenue from a quarantine-free travel bubble agreement with Hong Kong has gone now that the plan has been shelved once again due to an uptick in virus cases in Singapore. On Wednesday, Singapore Airlines posted a record annual loss of S$4.3 billion ($3.2 billion). Their diverging fortunes reflect the state of the wider global aviation industry and world in general. Airlines in places like the U.S. and China are bouncing back despite limitations that still prevent international travel. Air China Ltd., for example, recently said its passenger traffic rose 218% in April from a year earlier. Borders are locked to many, yet inside these countries people are trying to return to a sense of normalcy -- going out to restaurants, sports events and concerts. And flying. Virgin Australia said Thursday it would add new routes, frequencies and staff. This from a company that went into administration a year ago under the pressure of Covid. On the other hand, Singapore is a relatively tiny island under a fresh round of social-distancing measures that include limiting gatherings to just two people. Five of seven so-called green lanes for business and official travel -- to Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea -- have been suspended, leaving just mainland China and Brunei. Singapore Airlines expects travel to pick up slowly in the coming months, but a forecast of passenger traffic reaching about 32% of pre-Covid levels by July is hardly rosy. “While domestic markets have recovered in some countries, international air travel remains severely constrained and its recovery trajectory is still unclear,” Singapore Airlines said in a statement Wednesday. Singapore Airlines’ shares still managed to gain 2.8% Thursday, paring much of the previous day’s 3.3% loss. The stock has had a roller-coaster few months, dropping 16% from an April high but still sitting about 35% higher than a year ago. Qantas has risen 33% over the past 12 months. It jumped as much as 5.1% Thursday, its biggest intraday gain since Feb. 25. The robust rebound in domestic travel is generating Qantas positive free cashflow of about A$100 million ($77 million) a month, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Teo, who said the carrier’s net debt could fall below December’s A$6.05 billion by June after peaking earlier this year. Qantas still forecasts a pretax loss of more than A$2 billion for the 12 months through June, showing that even the carriers emerging from the crisis are doing so with deep and long-lasting scars. “We have a long way still to go in this recovery, but it does feel like we’re slowly starting to turn the corner,” Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said in a statement Thursday. “The main driver is the rebound of domestic travel.”"

To think that would recover to the point we’d be profitable is unrealistic.” A full-year loss in 2020 would be the first for Southwest since 1972, a year after the Dallas-based discounter began flights. The company is still burning about $20 million in cash each day, Kelly said. That’s after Southwest has reduced its flight schedule and persuaded 17,000 employees -- 28% of the workforce -- to leave the company temporarily or permanently. Kelly’s acknowledgment that Southwest is headed for a yearly loss is consistent with Wall Street expectations. The company is expected to post an adjusted loss of $5.93 a share, based on the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Southwest fell less than 1% to $35.01 at 2:27 p.m. in New York. The shares dropped 35% this year through Tuesday, the best performance among large U.S. airlines. The spread of the virus and resurgence of cases in some parts of the U.S. gutted demand during the airline industry’s normally busy summer travel season. Many carriers have reduced flights further in their schedules after August as schools resume and demand traditionally slows. The industry is facing a “brutal low fare environment” as carriers cut ticket prices to try to lure travelers back on board, Kelly said. “Business travel has been crushed and will be very modest for a long time,” he said, adding it could take as long as 10 years for a recovery to 2019 levels. It’s “absolutely” possible for the Trump administration and Congress to end a stalemate and approve a six-month extension of federal aid to help cover airline payroll costs, Kelly said. Another $25 billion would extend a prohibition against involuntary job cuts through March of 2021 at airlines accepting aid. Nearly 150,000 workers at the four largest U.S. carriers already have agreed to take temporary leave or accept early-exit offers."

So far this year, the Federal Aviation Administration has proposed $563,800 in fines against at least 60 people for violations ranging from striking flight attendants to repeatedly refusing to don protective face masks, the agency said in a release. That includes $124,500 in penalties against eight people announced Tuesday. One is for a man on a Southwest Airlines Co. flight who allegedly hit a customer service agent in the jaw after refusing to wear a mask and an Alaska Airlines Inc. passenger who pushed a flight attendant, both in February. “The FAA is strictly enforcing a zero-tolerance policy toward passengers who cause disturbances on flights or fail to obey flight crew instructions in violation of the FAA’s regulations or engage in conduct proscribed by federal law,” the agency said in the release. The FAA has initiated 487 enforcement cases this year through Sunday, far exceeding the previous high for an entire year, 305 in 2004, the agency said. Of the 3,082 reports of unruly passengers in 2021 received by the FAA, 2,350 or 76% were related to face masks. The sharp climb in incidents coincides with rising political tensions associated with the 2020 presidential election and conflicts over masks. Federal law requires people on airlines and other public transportation to wear masks to protect against the spread of the novel coronavirus. Agency Administrator Steve Dickson announced on Jan. 13 that the agency was adopting a “zero tolerance” policy for misbehaving passengers. It came just a week after the Jan. 6 storming of Congress by supporters of President Donald Trump, many of whom had been disruptive on flights to and from Washington. In spite of efforts to tamp down misbehavior on planes, incidents continue to occur with regular videos on social media including passengers striking flight attendants and volunteers holding down unruly violators at the behest of flight crews. The FAA has no authority to bring criminal charges. A group of airline trade groups and industry unions on Monday sent a letter to the U.S. Justice Department seeking criminal charges against passengers."

With the migration of tens of thousands of holidaymakers already underway on the continent, European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune issued a “message of caution” and advised those who haven’t yet booked to go elsewhere or vacation domestically. The comments come as European Union countries introduce vaccination certificates intended to make travel easier. But the delta strain and the pickup in virus infections are hindering the reopening, with some governments delaying plans to ease restrictions, or even reintroducing them in some hotspots. And as countries look to move past the pandemic, new figures spell out the ongoing human cost, with the global death toll passing 4 million. Spain and Portugal have the highest 14-day case notification rate in Europe after Cyprus, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Both countries rely heavily on tourism and Beaune’s warning could put fledgling recoveries at risk. “The situation is particularly worrying, especially in Portugal,” Beaune said on France 2 TV. The government will discuss the situation Monday and could take action including border checks and local restrictions to try to stem the spread of the virus. The U.K. has already seen a jump in Covid cases, though the government there is pressing on with its reopening plans. In the EU, the increased threat of a new wave of infections is coinciding with an apparent slowdown in vaccination rates in some member states. As virus hotspots emerge, worried government officials have stepped up warnings about delta as well as the need to get inoculated. The Spanish region of Catalonia -- a magnet for tourists with its capital Barcelona -- currently has a 14-day infection rate of 290 per 100,000 people, compared with a national average of 118.5. The Balearic Islands, popular with German and British holidaymakers, have a rate of 191.5. Two weeks ago the rate in Catalonia was 46.3 and in the Balearics it was 36. In a report on the economy on Wednesday, the European Commission also made a plea for faster vaccinations, saying that risks from the spread of variants “underscore the importance of further picking up the pace.” Portugal the same day reported 3,285 new Covid-19 cases, the highest daily figure since Feb. 11. The latest figures are still a fraction of the daily record of more than 16,000 cases reported at the end of January, when the country faced one of the world’s worst outbreaks. Meanwhile, Greece’s new virus cases are rising at the fastest pace since early June, and the government plans to announce mandatory vaccinations for some workers next week. It’s already re-tightened measures at venues such as clubs and bars after a jump in cases among younger adults who frequent such places, and may introduce further curbs in the coming days. Still, the European Travel Commission expects travel activity to continue building momentum as the peak of the tourist season approaches thanks to increasing vaccinations and further easing of restrictions. “Europe is now managing the Covid risks well both for locals and our long-awaited travelers,” Luis Araujo, president of the industry body, said in a statement Thursday. “We therefore believe that safe travel is possible this summer.” Meanwhile, British travelers who have received both doses of a coronavirus vaccine will no longer need to isolate when they return home from moderate risk countries, under a plan officials expect to come into force this month. U.K. ministers have been working on an overhaul of pandemic rules for foreign trips to give more freedom to fully vaccinated passengers returning to England from destinations on the government’s “amber list.” Europe Threatened With Delta Now Faces Slower Vaccination Rates From Alpha to Delta, Why Virus Mutations Cause Alarm: QuickTake Covid-19 Deaths Reach 4 Million as India Eclipses U.S., U.K."

Shares of Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. fell every trading day since the space trip, erasing all the gains since early June in the worst week ever for the stock. By Friday, it was down 39% for the five-day period. While the successful launch was great marketing for space tourism, on Wall Street the enthusiasm quickly faded when Virgin Galactic followed it up with plans for a dilutive capital raise. That triggered a broader rethink of the timeline from Branson’s splashy first trip to a viable business based on would-be astronauts willing to pay a quarter of a million dollars to travel 53 miles above the earth. “Now that Virgin has proven it can do what it set out to do, some of the speculative luster has come off,” said Mario Ferro, an analyst at investment research firm ValueLine. The company’s plan to issue up to $500 million in new shares would only modestly dilute its current float, but given it also sold stock worth over $450 million last year, there’s concern that more share offerings will follow, Ferro said. The company has yet to book any revenue. Investors were also let down when the company didn’t follow up Branson’s trip with an update on the operating plans, including exactly how much future tickets will cost or when sales will resume. “There was certainly some disappointment among investors that there wasn’t any more of a material announcement, around either future revenue or opportunities, to support the growth story,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert said. Representatives for Virgin Galactic declined to comment on the rout in the stock this week. The company’s ultimate goal -- as laid out previously -- is to fly 400 trips per year from multiple spaceports that it plans to build, generating $1 billion in annual revenue from each one. According to analysts polled by Bloomberg, Wall Street expects the company to turn a profit in 2024, with an annual revenue of $385 million. “In time, one would assume that economies of scale will be achieved, making the experience more accessible. But that is likely a long ways off,” ValueLine’s Ferro said. In the meantime, the allure of a futuristic business plan, coupled with Branson’s charisma, ensures that the company has attracted a fan base among retail investors. The stock has risen more than 150% since October 2019, when it merged with a blank-check entity to enter the public markets. That’s a double-edged sword, however, because a large retail investor base tends to come with volatility. The extreme volatility seen this week may not last, but the stock can be expected to remain significantly more active than the broader market. After hitting a recent peak of 194 on July 8, Virgin Galactic’s implied volatility has fallen to 115, a hair away from its six-month average of 117. That number compares to a projected price swing of 52 for Tesla -- another growth stock that is often prone to sudden moves. The latest planned share offering is likely to result in more swings since the company is selling directly to retail investors, a process that has been in vogue recently with several so-called meme stocks like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and GameStop Corp. Just about 23% of Virgin Galactic’s outstanding shares are held by institutional shareholders, a number that contrasts with 57% for Tesla Inc., 63% for Amazon.com Inc. and 79% for Walmart Inc. Those numbers portend more volatility until stickier money from institutional investors buys into space travel. “Over time the company does need to find a way to attract more institutional investors and longer-term money, and as the business model matures that will start to happen,” Canaccord’s Herbert said."

Now they’re trying to get his government to relax travel restrictions it imposed in the early days of the pandemic. So far, they are losing the fight. Canada has exited many of the lockdown measures it adopted in March as the outbreak eases, killing fewer than a dozen people a day in the country of 38 million. Airports, though, remain deserted. Data from security checkpoints show passenger traffic in the first 26 days of July was 10% of last year’s levels, compared with 26% in the U.S. Calin Rovinescu, president and chief executive officer of Air Canada. A traveler wearing a protective mask uses a mobile phone at Toronto Pearson International Airport in March. The slow recovery is because Trudeau’s government has kept up the barricades, Air Canada says. Unlike in Europe, Canada’s travel restrictions have changed little since March. Foreign tourists are not allowed, even from places with few virus cases. Most business travel is banned and everyone coming in must stay isolated for 14 days, including returning Canadian residents with no symptoms, under threat of potential jail time if they break quarantine. Some provinces even require Canadians visiting from other regions to self-isolate for two weeks. “We need to start being able to earn some revenue,” Air Canada Chief Executive Officer Calin Rovinescu said in a video call this month with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “Right now it is the government that’s preventing us from doing that.” Analysts expect a 91% revenue drop when the carrier reports second-quarter earnings Friday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Montreal-based carrier has been spearheading a campaign urging the government to follow Europe’s gradual reopening. France and Spain allow Canadian residents to enter with few restrictions, for example. But Trudeau has resisted changes in the name of safety, the latest sign of a strikingly distant relationship between the airline and the government during the industry’s crisis. In contrast to most U.S. and European countries, Canada opted against an airline-specific plan as part of its crisis support package. Air Canada, which burned C$22 million ($16 million) a day in March to keep operating, laid off 20,000 employees, suspended 30 domestic routes and retired 79 jets. “There’s a sense of desperation on the part of Air Canada,” said John Gradek, a former executive at the company who teaches at McGill University’s Global Aviation Leadership Program in Montreal. “They’re burning through so much cash that they need to put the pressure on the government to loosen the restrictions.” Air Canada’s fate is tied to the recovery of international travel, a key part of its growth strategy in recent years as it added overseas routes, banking on flying foreign customers through Canada on their way to other destinations. Yet the uptick in global passenger demand in June was driven almost entirely by domestic flights, according to data from the International Air Transport Association. Strict isolation rules like Canada’s remain a concern for airlines worldwide. Only 17% of people surveyed in 11 countries by IATA last month saw quarantines as a measure they’d be willing to take to travel during or after the pandemic, against 39% who were ready to take a test at their departing airport. In a letter to government officials this month, Air Canada suggested Ottawa follow the U.K. and the European Union in exempting some countries from quarantine. For higher-risk countries, Canada could mirror places like Iceland, where testing on arrival is an alternative to quarantine, it said. Yet such decisions are politically sensitive and could potentially cause Canada to embarrass the U.S., by far its largest trading partner. The border between the two countries has been closed to non-essential travel since March 21, and will stay that way until at least Aug. 21. The U.S. has recorded about 13,400 Covid-19 cases per million people, more than four times Canada’s infection rate. Polls show Canadians support the border restrictions with the U.S., making it harder for the government to open up to travelers from other places. “I understand how difficult it is to see these travel restrictions in place but Canadians understand that keeping our cities, our municipalities, our elders, our front-line workers safe by preventing international travel is a continued thing we need to do,” Trudeau told reporters when asked about the letter. While airlines are now focused on getting Canada to crank the door open, they may pivot back to their initial request of seeking financial support, according to an industry group. “If we’re not going to move forward and we’re to keep the industry ostensibly operating at stage zero, then we do believe it will be reasonable to have conversations with the government about moving away from this non-sectoral approach they’ve taken,” said Mike McNaney, CEO of the National Airlines Council of Canada, which represents the largest carriers, including Air Canada and WestJet Airlines Ltd. As of July 24, government financing for the airline industry totaled almost $122 billion globally, from Australia to Germany to the U.S. according to Ishka, a consultancy. Support has ranged from grants and loans to equity stakes in exchange for cash. Ottawa has created a wage subsidy and a loan program that large companies can use. But the latter comes at a high cost -- an interest rate on unsecured debt that rises from 5% to 8% after the first year, plus warrants. “We know that airlines are facing significant challenges, and we will continue to engage with them and closely monitor the situation in the hard-hit aviation sector,” Transport Minister Marc Garneau said in a written statement. Air Canada entered the crisis with a balance sheet “probably in the best shape it’s ever been,” said Chris Murray, an analyst at ATB Capital Markets. The company, which has raised C$5.5 billion in new equity and debt since the pandemic began, probably doesn’t need government funding at this time, he said. The bigger question is “at what point you get a recovery.” That depends on when and where the airline can fly. McGill’s Gradek doesn’t think Air Canada will be able to sway the government, which has “significant leg to stand on when it comes to public health.” “I think Rovinescu is fighting a battle that he’s not going to win,” he said. “You don’t mess around biting the hand that feeds you.”"

Photos: Getty Images; Sputnik/Reuters But inside the central London headquarters of one of the world’s largest oil companies, there was an air of calm. It was January 2016. Bob Dudley had been at the helm of BP Plc for six years. He ought to have had as much reason to panic as anyone in the rest of his industry. The unflashy American had been predicting lower prices for months. He was being proved right, though that was hardly a reason to celebrate. On Jan. 20, 2016, the price of Brent crude oil plunged to $27.10 a barrel, the lowest in more than a decade. It was a nadir that would be reached again only in March 2020, when the Saudis launched another price war, this time targeting Russia, just as the coronavirus pandemic sapped global demand. When Dudley arrived in the Swiss ski resort of Davos for the World Economic Forum on Jan. 21, 2016, the industry was braced for more doom and gloom. Wearing a dark suit and blue tie, the BP chief executive officer made his way through the snowy streets. After one meeting, he was asked—as usual—for his oil forecast by a gaggle of journalists. “Prices will remain low for longer,” he said. This time, though, his by-then-well-known mantra came with a kicker: “But not forever.” Few understood the special significance of his comment. After months of slumping oil prices, BP’s traders had turned bullish. And, in complete secrecy, the company was putting money behind its conviction. Shortly before flying to Davos, Dudley had authorized a daring trade: BP would place a large bet on a rebound in oil prices. Although its stock is in the FTSE 100 index and owned by almost every British pension fund, this wager, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, has remained a closely guarded secret until now. BP was already heavily exposed to the price of oil. What the traders wanted to do was double down, to increase the exposure by buying futures contracts much as a hedge fund would. BP’s trading arm—staffed by about 3,000 people on its main trading floors in London, Chicago, Houston, and Singapore—argued that the price had fallen so far that it could only go up. And Dudley agreed. Quietly, BP bought Brent crude futures traded in London. It was a “management position”—a trade so large it couldn’t be the responsibility of any one trader and had to be overseen by the company’s most senior executives. The optimistic coda Dudley attached to his catchphrase in Davos proved prescient. By early February, oil was up by a third, trading above $35 a barrel. By the end of May, it was more than $50 a barrel. That’s when the company started to count the profits. The trade “made a lot of money,” says a former BP executive with direct knowledge of it. Another executive, who also was involved, put the payout at about $150 million to $200 million, declining to provide an exact figure. Publicly, however, BP —whose vast size means it’s not obligated to disclose even a windfall of that scale­­—said almost nothing. BP’s trades in the midst of the 2016 slump are a ­demonstration of one of Big Oil’s best-kept secrets. The company and its rivals Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SE aren’t just major oil producers; they’re also some of the world’s largest commodity traders. Shell, the most active of the three, is the world’s largest oil trader—ahead of independent houses such as Vitol Group and Glencore Plc. Massive trading floors that mirror those of Wall Street’s biggest banks are becoming increasingly important to the oil companies, which are driven by fears that global oil demand could start to drop in the next few years as climate change concerns reshape society’s—and investors’—­attitudes toward fossil fuel producers. No longer looked down upon as handmaidens to the engineers who built Big Oil, the traders are increasingly being seen as their companies’ saviors. The brightest stars can make more than $10 million a year, outstripping their bosses. Like BP’s 2016 trade, much about the oil majors’ trading exploits has never been reported. Bloomberg Markets pieced together the story of these lucrative but secretive operations through interviews with more than two dozen current and former traders and executives, some of which were conducted for The World for Sale, our new book on the history of commodity trading. The oil majors trade in physical energy markets, buying tankers of crude, gasoline, and diesel. And they do the same in natural gas and power markets via pipelines and electricity grids. But they do more than that: They also speculate in financial markets, buying and selling futures, options, and other financial derivatives in energy markets and beyond—from corn to metals—and closing deals with hedge funds, private equity firms, and investment banks. As little known as their trading is to the outside world, BP, Shell, and Total see it as the heart of their business. In a conference call with industry analysts last year, Ben van Beurden, CEO of Shell,  described the company’s trading in almost mystical terms: “It actually makes the magic.” And the wizardry pays off: In an average year, Shell makes as much as $4 billion in pretax profit from trading oil and gas; BP typically records from $2 billion to $3 billion ­annually; the French major Total not much less, according to people familiar with the three companies. In the case of BP, for instance, profits can equal roughly half of what the company’s upstream business of producing oil and gas makes in a normal year, such as 2019. In years of low prices, like 2016 or 2020, trading profits can far exceed those of the production business. Last year, both BP and Shell made about $1 billion above their typical profit target in oil and gas trading. One reason profits are so high is because the three companies can reduce their trading tax bill by routing their business through low-tax jurisdictions—a strategy not available to their oil pumping and refining businesses, which are rooted in physical infrastructure in particular countries. Shell, for example, concentrates all its trading of West African and Latin American crude via a subsidiary in the Bahamas. With just 36 traders in Nassau, Shell reported profits in the Bahamas of $847.5 million in 2019. Yet it didn’t pay a single dollar in taxes on those gains. Even better for the trio, trading profits tend to soar when markets are oversupplied, as was the case in 2015-16 and again in 2020, helping to cushion the blow of low prices on the traditional business of pumping and refining oil. Trading also gives them an edge over their U.S. rivals, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., which for historical and cultural reasons have eschewed trading. For most shareholders, however, the trading business is a black box. ""It is impossible to show exactly what we are doing, unless we want to completely open up our entire trading book, which is something we simply cannot do,"" Shell's van Beurden said last year when asked how much money the trading unit made. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanné, asked a similar question,  replied more bluntly: “The oil trading is a secret.” What isn’t a secret is the size of the trades. Together the three companies trade almost 30 million barrels a day of oil and other petroleum products, equal to the daily production of the entire OPEC cartel. Shell alone trades about 12 million barrels a day. That’s physical trading. The paper volumes are much larger. Total, for example, trades 6.9 million barrels of physical oil a day, but the equivalent of 31 million barrels of oil derivatives such as futures and options. With trading comes risk. The business “suits people who have a real commercial bent, a real desire to make money for the company,” Andrew Smith, head of trading at Shell, says in a recruiting video. They must be fearless, too: “They also have to be comfortable with taking risk. There are very few risk-free trades. Some days we make money; some days you’d lose money,” he says. BP, Shell, and Total declined to comment for this article. A few large companies came to dominate the industry, underpinned by their agreements to divvy up the oil resources of the Middle East. These companies, BP and Shell among them, were known as the Seven Sisters. Outside their ­oligopoly, there was very little left to buy or sell. BP was emblematic of the era. The British group had grown out of the Anglo-Persian Oil Co., established after oil was first struck in Iran in 1908, and by the early 1970s it could rely on a gusher of oil from its Iranian assets that provided much of the total 5 million barrels a day that it was pumping around the world. BP didn’t need to trade. Instead the nerve center of its business was the dull-sounding “scheduling department,” charged with arranging for BP barrels to be transported in BP tankers into BP refineries and sold into BP fuel stations. Already early traders such as Marc Rich, who founded the company that is today Glencore, were finding ways to trade oil outside the control of the Seven Sisters on the nascent spot market. The big oil companies regarded trading as beneath them and looked down on the upstarts, but they would soon be forced to think differently. The Iranian revolution of 1979 at a stroke dispossessed BP of much of its oil production. The company was forced to turn to the spot market that it had long disdained to buy the oil its refineries needed. Soon BP was doing much more than just buying oil for its own refineries. Andy Hall, then a young graduate working in its scheduling department in New York, would go on to be one of the most successful oil traders in history after leaving BP. He recalls that he started buying any oil that looked cheap, whether BP needed it or not, figuring to resell it at a profit. “We basically started trading oil like crazy,” he says. The oil price slump of the late 1990s set the stage for what the three large trading businesses would become as a wave of consolidation swept through the oil industry. When Exxon merged with Mobil, which had had a successful trading business, the nontrading culture of Exxon ­prevailed. The same happened when Chevron took over Texaco. The Americans were pretty much out of the trading business. Meanwhile, BP bought Amoco, which had a large trading unit, expanding its reach. The merger of French companies Total and Elf—both large traders—further consolidated Total’s trading business. Shell, too, reorganized and centralized its trading unit. By the time the wave of consolidation was over in 2000, the European trio emerged as the kings of oil trading. Their timing was exquisite: Commodity trading was about to enjoy an enormous boom as skyrocketing Chinese demand spurred a decade-long supercycle in prices. The floors don’t just look like Wall Street’s—they’re often located alongside them. BP’s London trading base isn’t at the company’s head office near Buckingham Palace, but in the banking hub of Canary Wharf. In Chicago its traders occupy the historic floor of the former Chicago Mercantile Exchange building. All in all, BP, Shell, and Total employ about 8,000 people in their trading divisions, a small fraction of their overall workforce of 250,000. The traders have more in common with the investment bankers across the road than they do with their colleagues sweating on oil rigs in Nigeria or mapping fields off the coast of Brazil. “Trading is a very uber-competitive environment,” Christine Sullivan, a 30-year veteran of Shell trading, says in one of the company’s ­recruiting videos. “Every day I can see the impact I’ve made to the bottom line. You see that moving up, hopefully, on a daily basis, and it just makes you want to do more.” Big Oil’s bosses like to say that speculation isn’t part of the business model of their trading units. That’s not really true. Within BP’s trading division, for example, there was for a number of years a pot of money traded, effectively, by a computer. The so-called Q Book was devised in the 1990s by two of BP’s in-house math whizzes—Chris Allen and Gordon Izatt—long before algorithmic trading became a dominant force in financial markets. The Q Book algorithm traded dozens of commodity futures including gold and corn, according to people with knowledge of it. And while BP shut down the Q Book a few years ago, it still has a unit that resembles an in-house hedge fund: The so-called Alpha One Book, run by Tim Hayes, aims to make money betting on financial commodity markets. At Shell and Total, there are similar groups. Even so, big speculative wagers on the direction of the price of oil, like the one BP took in 2016, are rare. The day-to-day job of the traders is a little like the role of the scheduling department of bygone eras, but with a healthy dose of entrepreneurial spirit thrown in. Their role gives them a huge position in the markets and opens up all kinds of opportunities to maximize profits. Last year, for example, Shell’s traders realized that the spreading coronavirus pandemic would have a catastrophic impact on international travel. They decided to bet that demand for jet fuel would collapse. It was a wager almost no other trader in the market could make on the scale that Shell did: Jet fuel is a niche market, dominated by refineries and airlines, and the market for jet fuel derivatives isn’t liquid enough for most traders to bet on easily. But Shell was well poised. It owns the Pernis refinery in Rotterdam—the largest in Europe, each day pumping out enough gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel to keep half of the cars, trucks, and planes in the Netherlands moving. It supplies jet fuel to Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport. In early 2020, before air travel shrank, Shell’s traders tweaked Pernis’s production, cutting out jet fuel entirely while increasing output of other refined products. Shell still had contracts to supply jet fuel, however, so the company was left with a big short position: It would have to buy jet fuel in the market to deliver to its customers, whatever the price, if the company’s traders were wrong about the pandemic. If the price went up, Shell stood to lose millions. Of course, the traders weren’t wrong. Jet fuel demand soon plunged 90% in northwestern Europe. Across Europe, prices fell from $666 a ton at the beginning of the year to $125 a ton by late April. “We could buy jet fuel, make money on that particular trade, and then again reconstitute the products coming out of the refinery to make money elsewhere,” Shell’s van Beurden  explained in an earnings call with investors in July. “That’s no ordinary trading. That is actually optimizing market positions that we know better than anybody how to take advantage of.” Shell didn’t disclose how much money it made on that single trade, but people familiar with the company said that in just the second quarter of 2020, the jet fuel traders made as much as they usually do in a whole year. For years their remuneration packages were a closely guarded secret. Then in 2006 a BP trader sued the company in the U.S. in a pay dispute. The legal fight that followed exposed the riches of Big Oil trading. The trader, Alison Myers, revealed that, on top of her regular annual salary of $150,000 for 2006, she was due a $5.5 million performance bonus—three times what BP’s then-CEO John Browne took home the same year. The legal battle revealed that others at BP did even better. The company said other traders took higher bonuses not only because their desks made more money, but also because speculative traders were generally better paid. “The market value of paper traders was higher than the value of physical traders,” BP said in a court filing. Since then, bonuses have only gone up. Nowadays many traders take home from $1 million to $10 million a year, and a handful even more. Every year at BP a list goes to the board for approval. It contains the names of the dozen or so traders whose bonuses are higher than those of the CEO, according to two people familiar with the process. At the top of the list typically sits the lead trader of the Cushing Book—the one responsible for buying and selling oil at the Oklahoma town that serves as the delivery point for the West Texas Intermediate benchmark. In a good year, this trader can make as much as $30 million, an amount that would outstrip the $23 million that David Solomon, the boss of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., took home in 2019. The immense scale of the oil companies’ trading units gives them outsize clout. Shell, as Bloomberg News has  reported, has in the past made bold trades that, while not illegal, have violated the unspoken rules governing this lightly regulated market. On one occasion in 2016, for example, Shell bought roughly 70% of the cargoes of North Sea crude available for a particular month, triggering wild price gyrations while squeezing out other traders who privately complained to Shell. At times, Big Oil traders have broken the rules outright. In 2007, BP paid more than $300 million to settle charges that it manipulated U.S. propane markets, for example. At the time the fine was one of largest ever for alleged market manipulation in commodities. Earlier, U.S. regulators fined Shell $300,000 for manipulating U.S. oil futures markets in 2003 and 2004 and $30 million for manipulating natural gas markets in 2000 and 2002. Still, constrained by the sheer size and high public profiles of the companies they work for, BP, Shell, and Total traders are nowhere near as swashbuckling as their counterparts at independent houses, who, history has shown, have been more willing to make a foray into countries where corruption is rife and where buying oil sometimes involves suitcases full of cash. That means the oil giants have left many of the juiciest deals to the independents. Brian Gilvary, a former BP head of finance, puts it this way: “Is there value available to us that could be captured over and above what we capture today? Absolutely. Are we prepared to take the risk associated with that? Definitely no. I can give you a list of countries, but you know where they are.” The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act on financial reforms required all major players in the swaps market to register themselves. There were the usual suspects: Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, ­JPMorgan, and other financial behemoths. And then there were three names that seemed out of place: Cargill, the world’s largest trader of agricultural commodities, BP, and Shell. As Wall Street banks scaled back their presence in commodities in the post-crisis world, Big Oil stepped in. Shell, for example, in 2016  became the first nonbank to move in on what commodity traders at Wall Street banks see as their largest annual deal: helping the Mexican government hedge its exposure to the price of oil. For its part, BP, in a brochure for its trading unit, says, “Our customers also include banks, hedge funds and private equity firms.” The document lists a range of financial ­strategies it can help customers implement—from “options (vanilla & tailored)” to “tiered volume restructure.” With investors of all kinds increasingly unimpressed by the traditional oil-pumping business, trading is ­becoming an ever more important part of the oil companies’ sales pitch. In a virtual meeting with investors in October 2020, Shell’s van Beurden described the company’s trading unit as “absolutely core to the success of our company.” Even Exxon, which long sneered at trading as an unnecessary distraction, has changed its stance, hiring experienced oil traders to start making bets with the company’s money. As BP shifts its investments from fossil fuels to renewable energy, its traders will help it juice the relatively low returns on those investments, Bernard Looney, who last year succeeded Dudley as CEO, said in a presentation to investors in 2020. Renewable energy projects typically generate returns of 5% to 6%, he said, but the company’s expert traders can add about 2 percentage points to that. As steeped as BP may seem to be in the rigs and offshore platforms and snaking pipelines of yesteryear, Looney painted an energy future that encompasses electric cars, hydrogen, and biofuels. “We love complexity like this,” he said. “It is why we have elevated our trading function to the leadership table.” Blas and Farchy cover energy out of London. Their book, The World for Sale: Money, Power, and the Traders Who Barter the Earth’s Resources, was published in the U.K. in February by Random House Business and in the U.S. in March by Oxford University Press. Unlike most of his peers, Dudley was no passive observer. At the heart of BP, far removed from the sprawling network of oil fields, refineries, and service stations that the company is known for, sits a vast trading unit, combining the logistical prowess of an air traffic control center with the master-of-the-universe swagger of a macro hedge fund. And, unknown to all but a few company insiders, BP’s traders had spotted, in the teeth of the oil price collapse, an opportunity. Over the course of 2015, Dudley had acquired a reputation as the oil industry’s Cassandra. Oil prices had been under pressure ever since Saudi Arabia launched a price war against U.S. shale producers a year earlier. When crude prices started falling, he confidently predicted they would remain “lower for longer.” A few months later, he went further. Oil prices, he said, were due to stay “lower for even longer.”"

From the scores of new rules for cutting carbon across the economy, we summarize below the key elements of the so-called Fit for 55 package -- the EU’s program to slash pollution by at least 55% from 1990 levels. While several years of negotiation are expected before the planned legislation comes into force, there are major changes afoot for citizens and industry. Here’s a look at some of the biggest -- from the price of a plane ticket to the cost of heating your home. In plain English: Cutting emissions faster What it will entail: The EU wants to use its world-leading carbon market to cut enough emissions to reach its new 2030 target. To do so, it plans to quicken the pace at which emission caps shrink each year, forcing manufacturers, power producers and airlines to curtail their carbon footprint more swiftly. Why it matters: This will be the biggest overhaul of the Emissions Trading System to date, affecting everything from the price of flights to the cost of your electricity bill -- though there’ll be a social fund to help those hardest-hit. Carbon prices briefly jumped on Wednesday following the release of the proposals. In plain English: Making sure Europe doesn’t get undercut What it will entail: In a world-first, the EU plans to introduce an import levy for steel, cement and aluminum produced in other countries with lower environmental standards. Importers will have to buy special certificates at a price linked to the Emissions Trading System -- effectively a penalty for bringing in such goods, which will also include fertilizers and power. Why it matters: The EU knows that an ambitious climate plan comes with its downsides; namely, its companies could be vulnerable to competitors outside the bloc that aren’t subject to the same stringent environmental rules. This is an effort to address that risk, and has global ramifications, potentially spurring other countries to step up their own climate efforts. Yet the system will be complex -- to ensure it meets global trade rules -- and even the most meticulous design won’t eliminate the risk of diplomatic rifts with EU trading partners, from the U.S. to Russia or China. In plain English: Ending exemptions for some of the highest-polluting sectors What it will entail: The shipping industry will be included in the Emissions Trading System for the first time, while airlines -- already included -- will eventually have to pay for all the pollution their planes produce. The Commission also wants to see more sustainable aviation fuel blended into regular jet fuel, and is proposing a fuel-tax system to impose minimum levies on both shipping and aircraft sectors. Why it matters: Despite the transport industry’s high emissions, shipping and aviation have been largely exempt from the strictest environmental regulations until now. Low-cost airlines may be particularly hard-hit by the new rules, and passengers could face higher ticket costs as a result. But the regulations could give a boost to the fledgling sustainable-fuel industry, and -- as travelers choose greener options -- to the region’s rail sector. In plain English: Getting rid of the combustion engine What it entails: The EU is proposing that emissions from new cars fall by 55% from 2030 and drop to zero from 2035. That marks a significant tightening of current targets, which require only a 37.5% reduction from 2030, though it falls short of the expected 65% cut. Why it matters: Passenger cars account for about 12% of total EU CO2 emissions, so curbing that output will be key to achieving the bloc’s goals. The policy will bolster demand for electric models, and carmakers are getting prepared. Volkswagen AG, the region’s largest manufacturer, for example, expects more than 70% of its namesake brand sales to be electric from 2030. The regulation could also boost infrastructure, since it will require member states to install charging points at regular intervals along major highways. In plain English: Boosting the share of energy from renewable sources What it entails: The EU’s executive is proposing to raise its renewables target to 40% of the energy mix by the end of the decade, from the existing 32% goal. It’s also aiming to expand the share of clean fuels in transport. Why it matters: Europe needs to double the share of electricity produced from renewable sources to be in with a chance of meeting its goals. The new regulation will be a boon to producers of renewable energy, which has already overtaken fossil fuels as the dominant power source in Europe’s electric grid. In plain English: Saving more energy What it will entail: The Commission wants to promote energy efficiency across multiple sectors, from construction and agriculture to transport and communications. It plans to mandate all public bodies to renovate their buildings so that they waste less energy. Efficiency requirements will have to be considered in public tenders and governments will have to focus on increasing energy savings among vulnerable consumers, helping to alleviate energy poverty. Why it matters: The EU only achieved its 2020 energy efficiency target due to “exceptional circumstances,” a clear reference to the economic impact of the pandemic. Current national climate and energy plans for 2030 are too weak -- providing for a 29.4% reduction in energy consumption across the continent, below the existing EU objective for 32.5% efficiency. In plain English: How the EU plans to absorb more carbon from the atmosphere What it entails: The EU wants to increase the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by “sinks” such as forests and grasslands -- to 310 million tons a year by 2030 from around 270 million tons currently. The bloc is also working on a system of carbon-removal certificates, which would help curb emissions in agriculture by allowing farmers to offset their pollution. Why it matters: The EU knows it’s not just about reducing emissions, but about absorbing what’s already out there. The proposals would require stronger protections for forests, but the actual cost is relatively low: between five euros and 10 euros for every ton of CO2 soaked up from the atmosphere.

Soiled sheets. Trash piling up in the hallways. James Androuais saw it all during the 100-plus nights he spent on the road last year, as low occupancy rates and Covid-19 precautions pushed hotel operators to let traditional service standards slide. Now Americans are making up for lost vacations and corporate travelers are starting to get back on the road, putting hotels under pressure to step up their game. But labor shortages have made it hard for companies to find workers after mass layoffs, leading to continued cutbacks on some services that guests took for granted before the pandemic. Androuais, who spends most of his nights in InterContinental Hotels Group Plc’s system, said that he’s learned to lower his expectations, whether he’s staying at a Holiday Inn Express or one of the company’s higher-end brands. Service hasn’t been uniformly bad, but it’s been inconsistent, and at times he’s sought new accommodations. “Going into some of these hotels and seeing trash bags and trays left in the hallways at 10 p.m. is not at all a welcome sight,” said Androuais, who owns a company that makes custom clocks for buildings. Jacob Hawkins, a spokesman for IHG, said the safety and comfort of guests is “top of mind” and that the company will be following up with Androuais. “As our industry continues to recover from the impact of Covid-19, we appreciate our guests’ patience and understanding as IHG hotels continue to return to normal levels of business and operations,” Hawkins said. Across the U.S., employers from restaurant operators to manufacturers are struggling to find workers as the economy rebounds. In the tourism industry, consumers have unleashed a leisure-travel boom that has brought hotel performance back to 2019 levels. Yet labor shortages are holding back growth and leading some businesses to limit services and capacity, the Federal Reserve said in its Beige Book survey this week. Hotel companies’ reopening pains date back to March 2020, when Covid-19 brought global travel to a halt and properties shut down to save money. During the industry’s worst days, occupancy rates hovered around 20%, and seven out of 10 hotel workers had been furloughed or laid off. At the same time, hotels implemented new cleaning protocols designed to keep guests and workers safe. Breakfast buffets were scrapped, and restaurants closed. Room cleaning -- traditionally a daily standard unless guests opted out -- instead became available only by request at many properties. In some cases, hotels refused to service rooms until after checkout. Mike Emeigh, a consultant who spent more than 200 nights in hotels in 2019, has noticed that some changes are still in place as he gets back on the road. He requested daily housekeeping during a recent stay in Portland, Oregon, but found the service wanting. Trash cans weren’t emptied consistently, and on one day, the towels weren’t swapped out, even though he’d left them on the floor. “I think people are trying,” said Emeigh. “They were understaffed.” Hotel companies have suggested that many of these changes could stick. For the time being, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. has revised the housekeeping policy at many of its brands from opt-out to by request. And owners including Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. and Braemar Hotels & Resorts Inc. have told investors that they expect to save money by operating hotels with less labor. Rehiring employees has proved challenging, with more than half of hospitality workers in a recent survey saying that they wouldn’t go back to their old jobs. Half of U.S. Hospitality Workers Won’t Return in Job Crunch Extended unemployment insurance has given some workers an incentive to stay home. Hotels are also competing with employers like Amazon.com Inc. that -- unlike lodging companies -- thrived during the pandemic, Marriott International Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tony Capuano said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on July 14. Hawkins, the IHG spokesman, said his company is collaborating with other hotel operators and organizations such as the American Hotel & Lodging Association, which has launched a hiring campaign, to bring back workers quickly.Guests have been understanding so far. A recent study from J.D. Power showed guest satisfaction at North American hotels holding steady over the last two years, as flexible cancellation policies and cheaper rooms offset drags on service. But as travel rebounds and hotel pricing climbs, visitors are apt to raise their expectations. “If the traveler is going to pay premium rates, they want the restaurants and the spas open full time,” said Capuano. Albie Salvatore took his family on vacation recently to a favorite resort on Florida’s Gulf Coast. In the past, the property cleaned his condo and kept it stocked with basics like beach towels, toilet paper and dishwasher soap. That wasn’t the case this year, when his family often waited until late in the evening for housekeeping to drop off fresh towels and other supplies. “I’m on vacation, I don’t want to clean,” he said. “That should all be part of why I’m paying $1,000 a night to stay at a really nice place like this, and I shouldn’t have to wait until nighttime to get something that I need during the day.”"

The first increase in employment since January pointed to gains for the economy. But non-oil business activity improved at a slower pace, to its lowest level in four months, IHS Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Index showed Monday, as coronavirus-linked measures persisted and some flights were canceled. The gauge remained above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. “Business conditions continued to improve at only a gradual pace in June, adding evidence to a mixed initial recovery from Covid-19 in the UAE non-oil sector,” said David Owen, economist at IHS Markit. Private-sector employment in the UAE was battered last year by the pandemic. Job losses, especially in Dubai, led to an expat exodus whose impact is still felt in the city. The U.S. last week raised its travel warning for the UAE to its highest level due to the virus. In Saudi Arabia, which has banned its citizens from traveling to the UAE without receiving prior approval, business conditions continued an upward trend. New business growth in the kingdom was at the highest level in five months. Job creation also rose at the fastest pace since late 2019, but was modest overall, IHS Markit said.

The American Civil Liberties Union wrote the letter on behalf of Seattle-based flight attendant Justin Wetherell, whose gender identity is nonbinary, or not strictly male or female, and whose gender expression is fluid and can change over time.  Alaska Airlines allegedly has “male” and “female” dress and grooming requirements, allowing transgender workers to adhere to standards that match their gender identity, according to the letter. But the policy “demeans employees who do not conform to gender stereotypes and materially interferes with their ability to do their jobs under equal terms and conditions as other employees.” “Justin has repeatedly been refused the opportunity to meet and discuss flight attendant standards with executive management, and Justin’s perspective as a non-binary individual and complaints of discrimination have been summarily dismissed,” the letter said, alleging that the airline’s policy violates Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and Washington state law. Wetherell has filed a discrimination complaint with the Washington State Human Rights Commission, the ACLU told Bloomberg Law. Workers generally must file bias charges with an administrative agency before they can sue, at least under federal law. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that Title VII prohibited workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and transgender status, but didn’t specifically address dress codes and other related LGBT issues. Democrats are pushing legislation to further expand federal civil rights protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. “Policies such as the Alaska Airlines uniform policy, under which a woman faces discipline or disadvantage for dressing in a manner that would be permitted if she were a man, (or a man faces discipline or disadvantage for dressing in a manner that would be permitted if he were a woman) discriminate ‘but for’ the employee’s sex within the meaning of Title VII,” the letter said. ACLU senior staff attorneys Joshua Block and Galen Leigh Sherwin and ACLU of Washington Foundation staff attorney Lisa Nowlin signed the letter. Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Cailee Olson said in an emailed statement that the company is a “longtime supporter of the LGBTQ+ community,” and has been a “leader in the industry when it comes to inclusivity in our uniform and grooming standards, which have been informed by our employees and developed in accordance with federal and state laws.”  Over the past year, she said, the company has introduced new guidelines designed to give flight attendants more inclusive uniform options.  Since early 2020, for example, all flight attendants have been able to order any pant or parka style and have been able to select the uniform kit of their choice, regardless of gender identity, Olson said.  “We will also implement new gender-neutral hair policies that will allow all flight attendants to wear their hair down when not handling food, regardless of gender,” she said. “We are committed to continuing to explore uniform and grooming standards for our flight attendants. We know we cannot do this alone, and appreciate the feedback and partnership we have with our flight attendant community.” Asked for a response, the ACLU’s Block said in an emailed statement, “As our letter makes clear, if Alaska Airlines continues to require that employees adhere to either a predetermined “male” uniform kit and grooming standards or a “female” uniform kit and grooming standards, it will be violating the Washington Law Against Discrimination and Title VII.” He added, “We hope that after further consideration Alaska Airlines will work with us voluntarily to bring its uniform policy into full compliance with the law.” To contact the reporter on this story: Paige Smith in Washington at psmith@bloomberglaw.com To contact the editors responsible for this story: Jay-Anne B.

Here’s a run through the plans -- and key timings -- for aviation, shipping and makers of road-fuel. It’s important to remember that the proposals come from the European Commission and still require endorsement from both EU member states -- like France and Germany -- and the European Parliament to become laws. The whole process usually takes about two years, sometimes longer. The EU is planning to toughen greenhouse-gas emission rules for airlines. While flights within the bloc have already been included in its carbon market since 2012, the European Commission has now proposed phasing out free permits that carriers currently receive to cover their pollution. In 2019, OECD Europe’s oil-derived marine fuel market was 50.6 million tons, according to the International Energy Agency. That’s about 925,000 barrels a day, or, about 1% of global oil demand. As part of its proposals, the EU announced plans to include shipping in its Emissions Trading System, and a FuelEU Maritime initiative that aims to boost uptake of sustainable fuels. The EU is seeking to establish a new emissions-trading program for heating and road transport fuels. The market, adjacent to the existing EU ETS, will regulate fuel suppliers rather than households or car drivers. The number of such allowances will be gradually reduced to zero by the end of 2026, according to a proposal to reform the EU Emissions Trading System. The EU is hoping that will help cut greenhouse gases by the industry after aviation emissions increased 5% year-on-year between 2013 and 2018. The pollution levels dropped recently because of the pandemic, but they are forecast to grow further in the coming years. The EU’s measures also include requirements for airlines to increase the amount of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, blended in with kerosene on flights. The EU will mandate a 2% blend from 2025, rising ultimately to 63% by 2050. Currently, SAF amounts to less than 1% of total jet fuel, with cost and lack of supply the biggest hurdles. In addition, the EU is going to implement the international offsetting system, known as CORSIA, for flights into and out of the European Economic Area. When emissions from flights outside the EEA reach levels above 2019, they will have to be offset with corresponding carbon credits. The Commission wants offsets to be bought by airlines to contribute to emissions reductions in countries that participate in the Paris Agreement and, from 2027, in CORSIA. The ETS proposal would be phased in from 2023. The rules would apply to 100% of emissions for ships sailing to and from EU member states, and 50% of the emissions for ships traveling between the bloc and non-member states. The FuelEU Maritime initiative would be phased in from 2025 and ramped up more slowly. It limits the greenhouse gas intensity for energy used on board ships and applies to voyages in the same way as the ETS -- 100% of the energy used for intra-EU, 50% for journeys between the bloc and non-member states. The required reductions are against a baseline year of 2020. The system will start tp take effect from 2026. To prevent price spikes, the Commission proposed a mechanism that will inject emissions permits into the market from a special reserve if certain cost thresholds are breached. Consumers will be purchasing a lot less fuel for new vehicles if the EU succeeds in raising its target for CO2 emissions reduction from cars to 55%, from 37.5%, by the end of the decade. Researcher IHS Markit predicts that if the stricter goal is implemented, 55% of vehicles sold in 2030 will be powered entirely by battery. Traditional internal combustion engines will be virtually non-existent by then, with hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains making up the rest of the auto market."

Gross orders totaled 73 planes in May, including 61 for the single-aisle Max, Boeing said Tuesday on its website. Southwest Airlines Co. bolstered the tally by agreeing to take an additional 34 Max 7 planes, the smallest model, next year. The carrier will also step up deliveries through mid-decade and add another 32 options for handovers in 2026 and 2027. Boeing is booking its strongest commercial-aircraft orders since 2018 as it works to reestablish the 737 Max -- and placate customers with discounts -- after two fatal crashes and the longest jetliner grounding in U.S. history. The U.S. planemaker posted sales gains even as factory snarls and regulatory paperwork hampered deliveries of the Max early in the month and prompted another halt to 787 Dreamliner shipments. Southwest’s latest order and accelerated deliveries indicate that Boeing has holes in its near-term delivery schedule as it races to catch up to Airbus’s narrow-body output, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson. For Boeing, the Southwest deal “is a good endorsement of the airplane,” Ferguson said. “I think it’s an indication the 2022 skyline isn’t in great shape yet.” For the year, Boeing has tallied 380 airplane orders on a gross basis, with 177 net sales. Airbus has 31 more cancellations than gross sales so far. Deliveries are another story, however, as Boeing grapples with quality problems in its factories and stepped-up scrutiny from U.S. regulators. Last month, Airbus shipped 50 jetliners to Boeing’s 17. Deliveries unlock the lion’s share of customer payments for aircraft. A U.S. accounting provision helped Boeing’s order backlog swell to 4,121 in May as more airlines started to emerge from the collapse of air travel that accompanied the spread of the Covid-19 virus last year. The Chicago-based company added back 73 airplanes to its total based on its assessment of at-risk sales. Wide-body jets such as the 777 and Dreamliner accounted for 23 of the restored orders. Boeing also recorded 53 order cancellations and conversions, all but five of them for the latest 737 version. The tally includes 14 Max jets that were scrapped by Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA and 34 by Grupo Aeromexico SAB as the two carriers restructure operations."

The two countries are “putting systems in place that will enable such a bubble to emerge between Singapore and Australia as it does now occur between Australia and New Zealand,” Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison said at a joint virtual press conference after meeting Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday. He cautioned that any corridor is still some time away. Such a bubble hinges on vaccination rates, Lee told reporters. “Once the majority of the population is vaccinated, it becomes much easier for us to contemplate these openings up,” he said. That means an operational air-travel corridor could be months away, at least. Only about 5.5 million out of 26 million Australians have had at least one jab, meaning some border restrictions are likely to remain well into next year. Morrison’s government has abandoned its original October target to inoculate the population. Singapore and Australia are among a handful of Asia-Pacific countries that have managed to contain the coronavirus and have been reluctant to ease border restrictions. Australia has largely closed its shores to non-citizens and residents since last year, while Singapore doesn’t allow most short-term visitors to enter, except for those under programs such as a green lane for business travelers. Australia’s strategy of eliminating Covid-19 cases within the community has come under increasing pressure due to leaks of the virus into the community from hotels used to quarantine Australians returning from overseas, triggering localized lockdowns. Melbourne, the second-most populous city with more than 5 million people, exited a two-week lockdown on Friday. Morrison said discussions between the nations have included giving priority to students from Singapore to return to Australia to complete their studies. That would be a “first opportunity” for increased travel between the nations, he said. “When all the preparations are ready, then we can start small with an air-travel bubble to build confidence,” Lee said at the media conference. Morrison was on an official visit to the city-state, and is due in the U.K. to attend the Group of Seven leaders’ summit this weekend."

The department’s Office of Aviation Consumer Protection said that since March 1, 2020, it had received more than 6,000 complaints from consumers alleging Air Canada denied them refunds. In the complaint filed with an administrative law judge, the agency said it was seeking the civil penalty “for Air Canada’s extreme delays in providing the required refunds.” The agency said the large penalty is “intended to deter Air Canada and other carriers from committing similar violations in the future.” “When a carrier cancels or significantly changes a flight to or from the United States, the airline is responsible for providing refunds, upon request, according to U.S. law,” the agency said in a statement. Airlines have seven days to refund passengers from the date of the request for flights purchased with a credit card and 20 days for flights purchased with cash, according to the agency. Air Canada said in a statement that it believes that the Transportation Department is trying to enforce emergency guidelines that don’t have the force of law and plans to vigorously challenge it. “As stated in the department’s own Enforcement Notice and Covid-19 Refund FAQ, these documents constitute agency guidance documents, as opposed to properly issued regulations under the Administrative Procedures Act,” the company said. “As mere guidance, they cannot overrule or supersede the Department’s well-established regulatory framework, as instituting a new regulation requires public notice and comment.” Air Canada said it has refunded more than $1.2 billion to eligible customers who had refundable fares for travel that was affected by the coronavirus pandemic. “In addition, Air Canada has been refunding non-refundable tickets as part of the Government of Canada financial package, which made an unsecured credit facility of up to approximately $1.4 billion available to Air Canada to support the refund of non-refundable tickets,” the company said. “Since April 13, 2021, eligible customers, including eligible U.S. customers, who purchased a non-refundable ticket for travel on or after Feb. 1, 2020 but did not fly have been able to obtain a refund from the carrier.” The airline is required to file an answer to the complaint within 15 days, according to the Transportation Department."

The U.S. is not yet ready to lift restrictions on international passengers and will take a conditions-based approach to any relaxing of rules, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said. Quebec, which had some of the toughest restrictions in North America during the pandemic, says it won’t close its economy again if there’s another outbreak. Instead, Canada’s second-most populated province will only allow fully vaccinated people to access non-essential places like bars and gyms. The passport-based approach, which is still rare in Canada, will take effect on Sept. 1, leaving Quebeckers enough time to get a second shot, Health Minister Christian Dube said. Chile will loosen restrictions against for residents who are fully vaccinated as new cases plunge and the government expands one of the world’s fastest inoculation programs. Starting July 15, capacity rules for establishments like gyms and restaurants in districts that aren’t under quarantine will be relaxed for people with two doses, according to a government statement on Thursday. The nightly curfew will be shortened depending on virus and vaccination metrics, and schools will be able to open for on-site classes even in neighborhoods under strict lockdown. Myanmar announced two-week closure of all public and private schools across the country from Friday, as it reported 4,132 new cases, the highest single-day count since Covid-19 was first detected in March last year. Portugal said a nighttime curfew will apply to more municipalities as the government tries to contain an increase in infections.The limit to movement in public spaces between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. in regions including Lisbon will now be imposed in 60 municipalities, up from 45 municipalities previously, Presidency Minister Mariana Vieira da Silva said. Existing limits on weekend opening hours of restaurants and non-food stores will also apply to more municipalities, and remote working remains mandatory in those locations. The minister said that a negative Covid-19 test or a digital certificate will now be required at hotels. New York City will reduce classroom sizes and embark on curriculum changes when the U.S.’s largest public school system reopens -- fully in-person -- in September. The city will use billions of dollars in federal pandemic aid to retrofit school buildings, increase special education support, and bring a system-wide expansion of counseling and mental health resources for students traumatized after a year of the pandemic. Many of those students spent much of last year in remote learning. The city plans to add 140 teachers in 72 schools with the highest class sizes and permit two teachers in many classrooms for younger students. The Tokyo Olympics will ban domestic spectators in events held in Japan’s capital, revising an earlier decision to allow some fans, as the resurgence of virus cases pushed the government to declare a state of emergency in the city. The decision, announced by Olympics Minister Tamayo Marukawa, comes after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga declared a fourth state of emergency for Tokyo, running from July 12 through Aug. 22. Officials are still discussing the status of events to be held outside Tokyo. Why the 2020 Tokyo Olympics Will Be Like No Other: QuickTake The U.S. isn’t yet ready to lift restrictions on incoming international travel and ultimately the decision will be based on data, not arbitrary dates, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in an interview with Bloomberg. He added that the U.S. has working groups with the U.K., the European Union, Canada and Mexico to determine when it will be appropriate to lift the bans. “A lot of this is based on what’s going on with progress in the vaccines,” Buttigieg said. “We see good news and bad news in terms of the variants. One moment, you are reading about a variant across the world, next thing you know, it’s becoming the dominant strain in the U.S.” Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, who tested positive for Covid-19 over a week ago, was released from the hospital after being treated for four days. “The prime minister will take up his functions again” starting Friday, and will work from home for the rest of the week, the statement said. Shell has flown 85 workers to shore from the Shearwater oil and gas field after detecting 15 cases of coronavirus. The first case was identified in June 30 on a flotel, which is connected to the main platform. Shearwater was undergoing maintenance works and production will not be affected. Africa had its worst week of the coronavirus pandemic, with cases jumping 20% over the last 7 days, and the situation is expected to worsen, Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization’s Africa director, said on a conference call. There are “signs of hope” that the vaccine rollout on the continent is improving, she said. Still, the highly-transmissible delta variant has spread across the continent and is now dominating in many regions. Switzerland became the first country outside the European Economic Area to obtain equivalence for its Covid-19 certificates handed out to vaccinated or tested citizens. As of Friday, holders of a Swiss certificate will be able to travel inside the EU under the same conditions as holders of an EU Digital COVID Certificate. At the same time, Switzerland has agreed to accept the EU Digital Covid Certificate for travel to Switzerland. An Israeli hospital reported the first death of a coronavirus patient in the country in two weeks, Army Radio said. The 86-year old man had been fully vaccinated, the radio station said. Israel has recorded more than 6,400 coronavirus deaths since the start of the pandemic. More than 57% of the country has been fully vaccinated with Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine. The Health Ministry said earlier this week that the vaccine was less effective in recent weeks at keeping people from getting coronavirus, but it continues to provide a strong shield against severe Covid-19. Italy asked local health authorities to create a fast-track for the vaccination of teachers and school staff, as in some regions less than 80% of people in these categories has received a first dose. According to data collected by global database GISAID in the last four weeks, the delta variant accounts for about 28% of all cases identified in Italy. About 41% of people in the country have received both shots so far, data showed. Early Covid-19 cases traced to markets in Wuhan, China, mirror the initial spread of SARS 17 years earlier, scientists said in a paper that concludes that animal contagion is the most likely explanation for the pandemic’s genesis. The epidemiological history of SARS-CoV-2 is comparable to previous animal market-associated outbreaks of coronaviruses and offers a simple route for human exposure, Edward Holmes, Andrew Rambaut and 19 other researchers said Wednesday in a review of the scientific evidence pertaining to the pandemic’s origins. Excess deaths, seen as a more precise way of measuring total fatalities from the coronavirus, rose to their highest level since January in South Africa as the delta variant spread to all of the country’s nine provinces. In the week ended June 27, the country recorded 5,228 deaths compared with 1,729 official deaths from the virus, the South African Medical Research Council said in a report Wednesday. The number of deaths, which is measured against a historical average, was the highest since the week ending Jan. 24 and compared with 4,145 the week earlier. A health worker sprays sanitiser inside a testing site at the Fourways Life Hospital in Johannesburg on June 28. French tourists who haven’t yet booked holidays should refrain from going to Spain and Portugal amid a rapid progression of the delta variant virus, Clement Beaune, the nation’s European affairs minister, said on Thursday. “The situation is particularly worrying” in Spain and Portugal, Beaune said in a France 2 TV interview. British travelers who have received both doses of a coronavirus vaccine will no longer need to isolate when they return home from moderate risk countries, under a plan officials expect to come into force this month. Ministers have been working on an overhaul of pandemic rules for foreign trips to give more freedom to fully vaccinated passengers returning to England from destinations on the government’s “amber list.” Instead of isolating at home for 10 days, travelers will be told to take Covid tests after arrival under the new rules, which are due to be finalized on Thursday and could take effect as soon as July 19, people familiar with the matter said. The Tokyo Olympics will ban domestic spectators in events held in Japan’s capital, revising an earlier decision to allow some fans, as the resurgence of the virus pushed the government to declare a state of emergency in the city. Africa had its worst week of the pandemic, with the number of weekly cases rising 20% as the delta variant becomes dominant in most regions. The White House defended a push to support groups with door-to-door efforts to encourage vaccinations -- a day after Missouri Governor Mike Parson said it would “not be an effective or a welcome strategy.” Missouri has the U.S.’s highest percentage of cases caused by the delta variant, and vaccinations lag behind the national average. A team was dispatched earlier this week to southwestern Missouri, where the outbreak is straining medical capacity. On Thursday, Jeff Zients, the White House pandemic response coordinator, pushed back against the Republican governor’s tweeted comment, saying that “trusted messengers” like doctors or faith leaders were effective in helping boost vaccinations. “I would say for those individuals or organizations that are feeding misinformation and trying to mischaracterize this type of trusted messenger work, I believe you are doing a disservice to the country and to the doctors, the faith leaders, the community leaders and others who are working to get people vaccinated, save lives and help end this pandemic,” Zients said at a White House briefing.

The airline will post a loss before significant items and tax of as much as NZ$450 million ($315 million) for the year ended June 30 and foresees a “comparable” result in the 2022 financial year, it said in a trading update Friday in Wellington. The carrier, which plunged to its first annual loss in 18 years in 2020, said while it has seen a strong and sustained recovery in domestic travel demand, long-haul passenger volumes remain less than 5% of pre-Covid levels. “Despite the domestic market continuing to perform strongly and the fact that bookings on the Tasman and Cook Islands continue to build, a large degree of uncertainty remains,” Air New Zealand said. “The airline is not expecting any meaningful recovery in long-haul demand in the 2022 financial year, notwithstanding the roll out of global vaccination programs and the potential for long-haul borders to begin reopening progressively in the second half of the financial year.” New Zealand has opened quarantine-free travel corridors with Australia and the Cook Islands, but a significant reopening of its border is not expected for some time. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern aims to have a high percentage of the population vaccinated by the end of the year, but even then has spoken of a staged re-opening to other low-risk countries rather than a quick return to pre-pandemic travel norms. Air New Zealand, which traditionally generates two thirds of its revenue from international travel, said it has renegotiated the delivery date for the first of eight new Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which were ordered in 2019 prior to the outbreak of Covid-19. The first aircraft is now due to enter the fleet in the 2024 financial year, a year later than initially planned. Air New Zealand shares were little changed at NZ$1.61 at 10:18 a.m. in Wellington. The Auckland-based airline, 52% owned by the government, has so far drawn NZ$350 million of a NZ$1.5 billion Crown loan. It plans to undertake a capital raise before Sept. 30 and use a portion of the proceeds to repay any amounts drawn under the facility. Chief Executive Greg Foran said there have been achievements to celebrate in recent months. The airline has had positive earnings since September and has been operating cash flow positive since the second quarter of the 2021 financial year, he said, although that performance had benefited from the government’s air cargo support schemes, wage subsidies and other aviation relief packages. Air New Zealand has laid off about 4,000 staff since the onset of the pandemic. Foran said today that all 8,000 remaining permanent employees will be awarded NZ$1,000 worth of the company’s shares later this year in recognition of their efforts. In addition, after 15 months of reduced salaries, the airline will end employee salary reductions from July 1. “The airline has its eyes firmly set on the future as we move out of the survive phase and into revival mode,” Foran said. This meant further strengthening the core domestic business and “maintaining the hard-won structural cost reductions made across our business from the outset of this pandemic,” he said."

And airlines and tourism operators may face a prolonged recovery due to the nation’s slow vaccine roll out, which at this rate will take 2.4 years to cover 75% of the population with a two-dose jab. According to Boeing’s 2020-2039 commercial market outlook, domestic demand will be the first to bounce back to 2019 levels through 2021, while international traffic will recover by 2023. A growing economy and expanding middle class in India, home to world’s third-largest air-passenger market, will aid the aviation recovery and fuel demand for more than 2,200 new jets worth nearly $320 billion over the next 20 years, Boeing said. “Many more Indians will travel by airplane for leisure and business as incomes rise tied to industrialization and an economic growth rate in South Asia that leads all emerging markets,” said David Schulte, Boeing Commercial Airplanes’ managing director of regional marketing. “With greater demand for domestic, regional and long-haul travel, we anticipate India’s commercial fleet will grow fourfold by 2039.” Indian carriers have opportunities for growth in international markets, according to Boeing. Several have started or plan to start non-stop routes between India and North America to serve a passenger preference for direct service flights, Schulte said. To meet future demand for long-haul connectivity, especially to North America and Europe, Boeing forecasts a market for 260 new wide-body airplanes such as the 787 Dreamliner. Carriers in the South Asian nation are expected to need 1,960 new single-aisle airplanes over the next 20 years. India air cargo, meanwhile, will grow 6.3% annually over the coming two decades, driven by the country’s rising manufacturing and e-commerce sectors."

With fewer passenger planes in the air, there’s less room for freight that’s normally transported in their holds. That’s driven up demand for dedicated cargo jets to help handle the boom driven by online shopping, vaccine distribution and just-in-time supply chains. WATCH: Demand has been surging for cargo planes since the pandemic started. Source: Bloomberg) Pre-pandemic, 60% of all international air-cargo capacity was in the bellies of passenger aircraft, according to industry group IATA, and 2020 capacity shrank by almost a quarter. That shortage meant rates surged to all-time highs, based on a report by Sanford C. Bernstein. It’s unclear whether the boomlet for dedicated freighters will last when belly capacity will return with passenger jet frequencies. But Bernstein expects demand to remain strong as airlines only gradually restore full services while battling to repair their balance sheets. Carriers have even resorted to temporarily converting some passenger jets to freighters, pulling out seats to carry goods inside their main compartments. This strategy is profitable on routes with cargo rates priced above $4 per kilogram, Citi analysts wrote in a report on Feb. 23. Freight costs from Hong Kong to the U.S. were about $6.10 per kilogram in December and $5.30 per kilogram from Shanghai to Germany, they said. Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd. says it’s working flat out and is fully booked until 2022 for so-called passenger-to-freighter conversions. Luxembourg-based Cargo Facts Consulting expects about 90 aircraft to be converted to freighters in both 2021 and 2022. United Parcel Service Inc. expects 2021 to be another strong 12 months after posting record sales last year. Amazon.com Inc. is rapidly expanding its fleet of planes, and recently announced it would buy 11 used Boeing 767-300 jets, the first time the online retail giant has purchased, rather than leased, aircraft for its fast-growing air cargo operation."

Carriers are pushing to retain the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation over the European Union’s more rigorous Emissions Trading System, the think tank-said Thursday. While Corsia was developed by the United Nations-mandated International Civil Aviation Organization, a recent EU report said offsets are priced too cheaply to act as a brake on emissions. Planemaker Airbus SE meanwhile told EU officials in February that hydrogen-powered aircraft with more than 150 seats probably won’t feature globally until 2050, according to a presentation obtained by InfluenceMap via a freedom-of-information request. Carriers are also urging the EU to delay moves to sustainable aviation fuel, it said, with Air France-KLM backing compulsory use only as technology matures, Deutsche Lufthansa AG claiming competitiveness issues, and British Airways owner IAG SA saying SAF should be required only for intra-Europe flights. The International Air Transport Association said the report was a distortion of “genuine and long-standing sustainability efforts,” while A4E, which represents Europe’s leading airlines, said it failed to reflect the actions and investments of a sector that contributes 2.4% of total global emissions. Corsia was developed with the full participation of environmental organizations, and the number of countries enrolled continues to climb, according to ICAO. The program’s integrity depends on the quality of the offsets, with criteria published on the organization’s website, the group said in an email. The dissection of the aviation industry’s stance on carbon curbs highlights how pressure to accelerate efforts to meet increasingly tougher climate goals has ratcheted up. While automakers and some industrial sectors have made strides toward slashing emissions, airlines face a tougher challenge in going green given the energy expenditure required to get passenger jets airborne. Airlines are also utilizing the coronavirus crisis, which has roiled air travel, in an effort to delay taxes designed to push them into reducing emissions, according to InfluenceMap, which said it researched Europe’s 10 largest operators, together with Airbus, Boeing Co. and leading trade groups. Only EasyJet Plc has shown “more positive engagement” with the issue, it said. Airbus said last September it was working on three concepts for a hydrogen-powered plane that could enter service from 2035, including a traditional turbofan model designed to carry 120 to 200 passengers. According to the EU submission published by InfluenceMap, it could take until 2040 for aircraft with 100 to 150 seats -- below the size of a standard Airbus A320 or Boeing 737 -- to be deployed with electric or hydrogen power, while a mid-range plane of up to 250 seats probably wouldn’t use hydrogen until 2050. Only a 50 to 100 seat regional aircraft would be ready for hydrogen in the 2030s, the submission to European Commission Executive Vice President and climate chief Frans Timmermans says. Read: Airbus Turboprop Model Gaining Favor as First Hydrogen Plane Airbus declined to comment on what it called a private exchange, while saying that decisive joint actions are required by governments and industry to develop green technologies. In the shorter term, a reduction in emissions could be achieved by helping airlines fund a switch to new planes using 25% less fuel. IAG said it has supported the EU’s Emissions Trading System since its conception in 2008, but that with Europe producing only a small proportion of emissions, a global program like Corsia is needed. Air France-KLM declined to comment on the InfluenceMap report, while Lufthansa couldn’t be reached."

Some airlines like EasyJet quickly said they’ll offer cash refunds to customers whose travel was disrupted, while IAG SA’s British Airways and long-haul specialist Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. said they’ll limit compensation to vouchers or waive change fees. Irish discounter Ryanair said Sunday it’ll provide refunds where EU countries ban travel between Dec. 20 and Dec. 24, but not to other countries to which the airline is permitted to fly. Beyond the damage to their wallets, would-be travelers found their plans dashed. Twitter user Franchesca_3 said she was unable to board a flight from Britain to Sweden, where she is moving, on Sunday because it would stop in Amsterdam, where the Netherlands had prohibited U.K. arrivals. She said she’s hoping to get to her destination before Sweden follows with its own ban. U.K. Virus ‘Out of Control’; Cuomo Warns of Spread: Virus Update Europe Moves to Isolate U.K. as Mutant Virus Ruins Christmas Airlines Balk at Refunds as U.K. Tells Travelers Not to Fly Those thwarted trying to leave the U.K. risk being stranded without a place to stay. The Premier Inn Wimbledon Broadway in south London said it was open but anyone booking a room must prove they are there for a legitimate reason such as business, by showing a letter or email. Operators of small holiday lettings were also out of pocket. Airbnb told customers they may get a refund if travel is restricted, under a policy put into place before the latest rules were enacted. Cottages.com, Britain’s biggest provider of self-catering accommodations, told proprietors it was contacting all guests who live in a Tier 4 area -- including London and much of southeast England -- to cancel reservations and offer a later booking or refund. Scotland will move to Tier 4, the most severe U.K. lockdown category, from Dec. 26 through at least mid-January, while in Wales, all holiday accommodation must close, Cottages.com said. Rail stations serving express routes out of London were packed on Saturday night amid an exodus ahead of the new rules. Some travelers rented cars or booked taxis for journeys spanning hundreds of miles to flee the capital and be with loved ones for the holidays. The Department for Transport said on its website it will ensure that refunds are paid to all domestic rail and long-distance bus passengers who have canceled travel in England between Wednesday and Sunday, the previous Christmas travel window abandoned over the weekend. Eurostar International Ltd. said it will refund passengers unable to travel on its trains through the Channel Tunnel, though the impact will be limited by demand already running at less than 30% of the usual Christmas level. Motorists planning to travel to France on Eurotunnel’s vehicle shuttle were also unable to do so. Manduca, the Citigroup analyst, said the chaos at year-end would likely have a knock-on effect, causing some travelers to delay making bookings in the early part of the year for summer travel. While he expects negative sentiment on airline stocks in the short-term, he said low-cost carriers such as Ryanair could benefit from pricing power when travel snaps back. Airlines have become more nimble with costs and can more easily adapt to shorter booking lead-times, he said. “I don’t think it’ll have a big impact on the fundamentals,” he said. “Summer may be quite good.” A mutant strain of the coronavirus spreading rapidly in the U.K. led Prime Minister Boris Johnson to clamp down on holiday visits at home and abroad over the weekend. Airlines shares tumbled as Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium closed their borders to the former European Union state, with others preparing to follow suit. Airlines that were seeing a glint of the typical holiday bustle are now canceling flights or sending planes out empty so stranded Brits can return. U.K. hoteliers and operators of holiday lets are coming up empty during one of the busiest times of the year. Train operators contended with chaos over the weekend amid a rush to leave London, while travelers hoping to squeeze in a visit to family or a sunny getaway are spending time on the phone seeking refunds. “Fundamentally no one expected winter to be good,” Citigroup analyst Mark Manduca said of the airline industry’s year-end swoon. “We knew it was going to be bad, it is bad, it just turns out it’ll be very bad.” Shares of British Airways-owner IAG SA fell as much 20% while EasyJet Plc, the U.K.’s biggest discount carrier, dropped 18%. Ryanair Holdings Plc slumped 8% and Wizz Air Holdings Plc 11%. Tour operator TUI AG slid 12%. Before the latest lockdowns, airlines anticipated offering just under a million seats this week between the U.K. and western Europe, said Anne Correa, vice president for airline and airport services at consulting firm Morten Beyer & Agnew. While that’s down by more than two-thirds from a year ago, the run-up to Christmas was supposed to be one of the few bright spots for the industry this year. EasyJet and Ryanair could see the biggest impact on passenger numbers, since they sell 49% of the seats between the U.K. and Europe, she said. London Heathrow, Britain’s busiest airport, began suffering cancellations Sunday, with the upheaval extending to terminals including the London City business hub, which reported a significantly reduced schedule. “These bans are going to lead to the disruption of travel plans for thousands of travelers and the loss of peak revenues for the airlines,” said John Strickland of JLS Consulting. Who pays is often dependent on the fine print of plane and train tickets that few read until a crisis hits. On social media, customers engaged in refund battles with airlines, train operators and ticket brokers."

The State Department is staffing up to address a backlog of some 1.5 million passport applications, but ripple effects from the coronavirus pandemic mean it can still take several months for citizens to get their documents back, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Rachel Arndt told reporters on Wednesday. The department has “extremely limited” appointments for people who have urgent travel within 72 hours, but generally citizens should seek to apply for a passport or renewal about six months in advance of travel, Arndt said. Applicants can also pay an extra $60 to speed up the process but even the faster turnaround time will likely be 12 weeks, she added.

Airlines have loudly insisted that it’s safe to fly during the coronavirus pandemic, and U.S. travel is surging before the Thanksgiving holiday despite a nationwide spike in virus cases. Yet top U.S. infectious disease experts say the findings underpinning the carriers’ safety claims aren’t that conclusive. Concerned about the “misinterpretation” of their findings, researchers on a Defense Department study that has been widely cited by the industry added a cautionary revision. A senior expert in travel-health issues declined to participate in an airline trade group’s press conference, citing what he called their “bad math.” Prompted by the uncertainty, lawmakers on Wednesday called for more in-depth government research. “The airline industry got a little ahead of itself trying to say the risk is zero,” said David Freedman, a University of Alabama at Birmingham professor emeritus who balked at appearing with an International Air Transport Association event that cited his work. U.S. airlines, hit with an unprecedented drop in demand since the virus began spreading widely in March, are enjoying their strongest week since then. Even as health officials warn against travel during the Thanksgiving holiday because of a surge in Covid-19 cases, more than 4.9 million people traversed airports between Friday and Tuesday. The risk of being infected with the novel coronavirus on planes -- which have highly effective filters that remove virus from the air and where mask usage is required -- is probably fairly low, scientists say. Latest: U.S. Air Travelers Surge Over 1 Million in Holiday-Season Uptick But the research is far from clear and some recent cases have documented transmission on flights even when passengers wore masks and sat far apart, according to a review of recent cases and interviews with academics and disease specialists. “I definitely can say it’s premature to say that air travel is very safe,” said Qingyan Chen, an engineering professor at Purdue University in Indiana who’s written extensively on disease transmission on planes. Airline officials, responding to the historic drop in passengers, have repeatedly defended the protections against infection on flights. “Flying is safe,” Nicholas Calio, president of Airlines for America, a trade group for large carriers, said at a Nov. 12 briefing. “I will state that categorically.” A4A declined to add additional comments. It has highlighted the efforts to force passengers to wear masks and to remain apart during boarding and exiting, and to disinfect aircraft. Montreal-based IATA defended its use of Freedman’s data on confirmed in-flight transmissions, saying it never characterized the results as definitive. A4A has frequently cited a study by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, which was funded by the trade group and other aviation industry sources, that concluded the risk of transmission on an airliner was “very low.” But authors cautioned that their projections depended on adherence to mask usage and they also urged airlines to improve ventilation while planes are parked at the gate. Another study airlines point to was conducted by the Defense Department with the assistance of United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Boeing Co. It attempted to measure how aerosol virus particles were exhaled by a simulated masked passenger. United said in promotional materials released Oct. 15 the study “determined the risk is almost non-existent.” However, after news coverage of the study, the authors added a revision, saying they were “concerned about the potential misinterpretation of the findings.” They also acknowledged they based their results on a person exhaling relatively few virus particles, an amount well below levels documented in some cases. The airplane filters and mask usage “significantly reduces” exposure to infectious aerosols, they wrote. “However, the current established scientific understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics is not sufficient to calculate definitive SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk from these measurements of aerosol transport.” United spokeswoman Leslie Scott responded in an email that “Throughout the pandemic, our top priority has been the health and safety of our customers and crew.” “It’s why we supported military officials, medical experts and aviation engineers in their work demonstrating that aircraft cabins are among the safest of public indoor environments thanks to advanced air filtration systems, required mask-wearing and diligent cleaning protocols,” she added. Overall, there are few confirmed reports of infections linked to flights. However, because of limited contact tracing in the U.S. and the difficulty of finding transmission cases, it’s hard to say for sure what that means, researchers said. “I haven’t seen any studies come out and say it’s highly risky,” said Byron Jones, an engineering professor at Kansas State University who has studied airliner cabin-air safety. “But I haven’t seen the study that says it’s definitively safe either.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control summarizes the risks from air travel this way on its website: “Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes. However, keeping your distance is difficult on crowded flights, and sitting within six feet of others, sometimes for hours, may increase your risk of getting Covid-19.” Citing what they called the government’s unwillingness to create a plan for handling disease outbreaks in air travel -- which is required under an international treaty -- and the need for better understanding transmission, U.S. House of Representatives’ leaders on transportation policy asked a watchdog agency to study the issue. Representatives Peter DeFazio, the Oregon Democrat who is chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Rick Larsen, a Washington Democrat who heads the aviation subcommittee, called on the Government Accountability Office to review research on how the disease is spread in air travel, and the government and industry’s response. Until a vaccine against the coronavirus is widely distributed, “the U.S. airline industry will depend in large part on a better understanding of how diseases, particularly those that are airborne, spread through air travel and identifying technologies and practices that can help mitigate disease transmission,” the lawmakers said in a letter to the GAO on Wednesday. While some studies have shown cases in which no one on a flight became infected in spite of the presence of contagious passengers, other data have documented in-flight transmissions. Purdue’s Chen said he’s been following news reports in China of possible infection between passengers on a Nov. 9 Air China flight from Los Angeles to Tianjin. Ten people who weren’t connected to each other and resided in different parts of the U.S. tested positive for Covid-19 after arrival. All the passengers had tested negative for the disease before the flight, suggesting at least some of the transmission occurred on the plane, he said. Such incidents are confounding because they seem to contradict Chen’s own earlier research showing mask usage can dramatically lower risks of infection, he said. “That’s why I’m having doubts about what’s going on in airplanes,” he said. Government researchers in Ireland documented as many as 13 cases linked to a single flight last summer, according to a paper published in October. The infections in five of the cases were genetically linked, “strongly suggesting a single point source of infection,” the authors said. The wide-body jet was largely empty, people were spaced out on the plane and almost everyone whose activity could be documented said they wore masks. Nevertheless, the authors estimated that 10-18% of passengers became infected. “It is interesting that four of the flight cases were not seated next to any other positive case, had no contact in the transit lounge, wore face masks in-flight and would not be deemed close contacts under current guidance from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control,” the authors said."

Progress on Covid-19 vaccinations in the two countries could allow the U.S. to be included on the so-called Green List of countries from which people will be able to travel to Britain without quarantine, Heathrow Chief Executive Officer John Holland-Kaye said in an interview Thursday. While it wouldn’t necessarily be reciprocal, the move would make it easier to travel to the U.K. from the U.S. than from some parts of the European Union, where coronavirus shots haven’t been rolled out as quickly. Even a limited restart of U.S. services would come as a huge boost for Heathrow, which relies on the market for 20% of its traffic. The airport, Europe’s busiest prior to the pandemic, said passenger numbers remained stuck at just 9% of usual levels in the first quarter as current curbs limit operations at carriers such as British Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. Locations also likely to feature on the U.K. Green List include Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Israel and Iceland, plus some Caribbean destinations, the CEO said. Heathrow has been in constant communication with the government over the impact of the pandemic as well as plans for a resumption in travel. Holland-Kaye said he expects Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government to publish the country list as soon as the end of next week. The government has targeted a reopening of travel as soon as May 17, though the impact won’t be clear to airlines until criteria for how countries are divided between the three-category system are released. Arrivals from places marked green will still require a minimum of two Covid-19 tests, but those listed as amber or red will additionally face quarantines. Some short-haul leisure destinations could be green-listed, but most likely only to island sunspots such as Spain’s Balearics and Canaries, Holland-Kaye said. Mainland Spain and Greece may not feature until June and July respectively. The U.K. will confirm by early next month if international travel can resume on May 17, and which countries will fall into each category, a Department for Transport spokesman said in an email. While a full deal with the U.S. might be difficult to reach in time for the mid-May target, a unilateral U.K. reopening could allow Americans to fly into the country for business and leisure trips, Holland-Kaye said. In this scenario, Brits seeking to go to the U.S. would have to wait for the Biden administration to reciprocate. Bloomberg reported last week on bilateral talks between the U.S. and U.K. transport secretaries on a potential travel corridor. As with the U.S., restrictions in Australia and New Zealand would limit any significant bump-up in air travel until the measures were reciprocal. Both countries are currently closed to all except residents and citizens. The International Arrivals area at London Heathrow Airport in London. While the U.S. has restricted entry from European countries including the U.K., Americans are allowed leave and return freely. The policy has led to a mini-boom in pandemic travel to Cancun in Mexico. The European Union, which is behind the U.S. and U.K. in vaccinations, is also rushing to get a system in place that will allow for cross-border travel. On Thursday, EasyJet Plc CEO Johan Lundgren called on the U.K. to put most of Europe on the Green List, saying studies show it would be safe. In an Aviation Club U.K. webinar, the low-cost carrier reiterated its plea for the government to publish the standards that will determine the traffic-light tiers and name the countries on the green list. Heathrow said earlier that it may attract only 13 million passengers this year if travel markets aren’t reopened, increasing to 36 million in a best-case scenario. The hub lured 81 million travelers in 2019, a figure that fell to 22 million last year."

The offer values Sydney Airport shares at A$8.25 each, the company said in a statement Monday. While that’s 42% higher than Friday’s closing price, it’s below the stock’s peak of around A$9 in late 2019 before Covid-19 devastated aviation. The shares closed up 34% to A$7.76 on Monday. “A takeover bid for Sydney Airport could enable early monetization of its recovery potential, which may only be visible in 2022 as vaccination promotes a more-sustained traffic rebound. Yet the indicative price is 8% below its pre-pandemic peak, and may not reflect the long-term return opportunities for this long-duration, essential infrastructure.” Sydney Airport Offer at Premium Now, Not Pre-Covid: M&A Snapshot The suitors are seeking to capitalize on the slump in market value at Australia’s largest airport before global travel starts to pick up. While airlines worldwide have received billions of dollars in government handouts to survive the crisis, infrastructure providers like airports haven’t been helped on the same scale. Sydney Airport, Australia’s main overseas gateway, has also been smashed by one of the most restrictive border policies of the global health crisis. The government effectively closed the international border in March last year, and also barred citizens from leaving. On the eve of the pandemic, close to 4 million passengers passed through Sydney Airport every month, a figure that almost completely evaporated within weeks. The border is expected to stay closed until mid-2022 given Australia’s lagging vaccination program. Rolling state border closures to contain sporadic outbreaks have also played havoc with domestic travel. Sydney is in the midst of a two-week lockdown coinciding with winter school holidays when many people usually head north to warmer climes in Queensland. However, a buyer of Sydney Airport may not have to wait long before air-travel demand more than recovers its losses. According to the International Air Transport Association, which represents almost 300 airlines worldwide, global passenger numbers will surpass pre-Covid levels in 2023. IFM Investors, an infrastructure manager owned by a group of Australian not-for-profit pension funds, is a long-term investor that can weather another year of travel restrictions on a bet that tourism will soon return to normal. Including debt, the offer values Sydney Airport at A$30.4 billion, or about five times more than the A$5.6 billion the airport fetched when it was sold by the government in 2002. IFM’s airport assets include Manchester Airports Group and Vienna International Airport, as well as stake in gateways in Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane. Collectively, the consortium has more than A$177 billion of infrastructure funds under management globally, including stakes in 20 airports, it said in a separate statement on Monday. Sydney Airport said it’s considering “whether the proposal is reflective of the underlying value of the airport given its long-term remaining concession and the expected short-term impact of the pandemic.” A successful deal at the offer price would be the largest on record for an Australian company inclusive of debt, eclipsing the A$29 billion Europe’s Unibail-Rodamco paid for mall owner Westfield in 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sydney Airport named Barrenjoey Capital Partners and UBS Group AG as financial advisers. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is advising the bidding group, which also includes QSuper Board and Global Infrastructure Management LLC. One of the conditions of the offer is that Australian pension fund UniSuper Ltd., which owns about 15% of Sydney Airport, agrees to reinvest its equity interest for an equivalent stake in the consortium’s holding vehicle, according to the statement."

Recovered wheels from the Lion Air 737 Max that crashed off the coast of Indonesia in November 2018, killing all aboard.  Fatal flaws in the Boeing Co. 737 Max have been addressed and the plane is now  safe to fly, U.S. aviation regulators contend. Yet for many airline travelers, a central question remains: Do I feel safe flying in a plane that crashed twice, killing 346 people? “There’s no way I’m flying it, period,” said Jon Bonne, a New York-based food and wine writer. “No one in commercial aviation scraps a bad airplane and just starts over. So we’re stuck with the Max.” People keep asking ""would you fly the #737MAX"" and my answer is simple: At some point I won't have a choice if I want to get somewhere, and that'll be that.Though I will say that the resumption of flights next month should not be celebrated or turned into an event. People died. American said that if its passengers don’t want to fly on a 737 Max, they won’t have to. “If a customer prefers to not fly on this aircraft, we’ll provide flexibility to ensure they can be easily re-accommodated,” the carrier said in a message to employees. Southwest and United are also offering similar options to leery passengers. While the coronavirus has decimated the aviation industry, it may also serve to drown out media scrutiny of the Max’s return, said Spud Hilton, a former travel editor at the San Francisco Chronicle. He said he’ll fly on the Max without trepidation, and noted that most airline travelers don’t pay attention to which aircraft type they’re on anyway.   Read More: Mother of Pilot Killed in 737 Max Crash Criticizes FAA, Boeing for Rushing Comeback “Because of the pandemic, I think people are a lot more worried to get on any plane than on any specific plane,” Hilton said. “I don’t mean to say that the 737 Max has benefited from the pandemic, but the pandemic has certainly taken a lot of attention away from its history.” John DiScala of Los Angeles, who runs JohnnyJet.com, a travel news and credit card referral website, said he won’t hesitate to fly on a Max, because of the global regulatory scrutiny it’s received—and as a result, Boeing’s effort to fix it. “But it’s not my plane of choice,” he added, pointing not to its crashes, but to its often tight cabin configurations. But others are unwilling to give Boeing a second chance. “I do not like this track record,” said Alison Hansen, a corporate learning executive in Dallas. “Given options, what would be the reason to choose that plane? There’s no reason.” Boeing’s Max development  was plagued by missteps, including faulty assumptions about pilots’ reactions and U.S. regulators who were ill-prepared to assess Boeing’s design changes,  according to an international safety review released in October 2019. In a statement Wednesday, Boeing Chief Executive Officer David Calhoun said the Max crashes “have reshaped our company and further focused our attention on our core values.” The Max has likely emerged from its 20-month grounding as a safer model than most because of probes by multiple regulators, said Jamie Perry, a marketing executive in New York and a former airline executive. “I would have had qualms about flying it after the two crashes—but before it was grounded,” he wrote in a note Wednesday. “Then it felt high risk. I don’t feel that way now.” An open question for Boeing and the airlines who buy its planes is how long will the Max’s reputation linger in the mind of travelers? It could be a case where customer fears mar the plane for only a short time—unless there’s another major incident. “That perception will hang around for years, but it won’t necessarily be a deterrent,” Hilton predicted. “It’ll just be ‘Oh yeah, remember when this thing used to fall out of the sky?’” The Max’s catastrophic failures were attributed to Boeing’s shortcomings and U.S. regulators’ deference to the industry they govern. “That’s what caused the Max to get off the factory line with a whole lot of problems,” said Jerry Elmas, a sales executive in Austin, Texas, who plans to “wait a couple of years” before flying on a Max, even if it means adding a connection to one of his trips. “I’m a business person,” he said. “If I kill my customers, they don’t come back. It’s the oddest thing.” Others noted that the Max is now among the most analyzed aircraft in history, given the aftermath of the late 2018 crash off Indonesia and the second disaster a few months later in Ethiopia. Having grounded the plane in March 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration lifted its order on Wednesday. “I guess I just trust enough in the airline industry given their overall record,” said Kristen O’Brien, a writer in Austin, Texas. “The Max has been so scrutinized now that I feel like, if anything, it’s got to be safer than other planes.” The four U.S. airlines that have bought the 737 Max are  preparing to return it to service in coming months, with American Airlines Group Inc. leading the way in late December on flights between its Miami hub and New York’s LaGuardia Airport.    QuicktakeQuickTake: When Will the Boeing 737 Max Fly Again and More Questions United Airlines Holdings Inc. said each one of its Max airplanes will require about 1,000 hours of work and training before resuming service in the first quarter of 2021. Alaska Airlines will take the first of its 32 aircraft in January and begin customer flights in March. Southwest Airlines Co., the largest Max customer, plans to resume flying the plane in the second quarter. “If we had a cause for doubt of the safety of our fleet—or any subset of it—simply put, the planes would not fly,” Southwest Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said Wednesday in a customer letter."

U.S. airport security checkpoints processed 1,031,505 people, or 39.6% of the equivalent day in 2019, according to a tally by the Transportation Security Administration. Several of the busiest days since mid-March have occurred in the past two weeks and passenger loads have been gradually increasing, but that provides scant relief for an industry still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. If Sunday’s level were maintained for an entire year, it would roughly roll the industry back to levels last seen 36 years ago, according to the trade group for large carriers, Airlines for America. The steep drop in flyers has prompted billions of dollars of losses and tens of thousands of job cuts or voluntary furloughs as impacts reverberate across the aviation industry. A federal aid package that had covered the costs of airline payrolls and forbid job cuts expired on Oct. 1 and attempts to extend it have faltered in partisan gridlock. U.S. airlines rose, with a Standard & Poor’s index of major carriers advancing 1.8% at 9:59 a.m. in New York. United Airlines Holdings Inc. led the gains, climbing 3.5% to $35.35. United and Delta Air Lines Inc. said last week that they expect a long, slow recovery until there’s a vaccine. Sunday was the busiest day for air travel since March 16, when 1.26 million people passed through domestic screening, according to the TSA. At that time as the new coronavirus was first exploding in the U.S., passengers were canceling flights en masse. Within weeks, the average number of flyers had fallen to less than 100,000 per day, a drop of 96% from 2019 numbers. People have incrementally returned to the skies, but in far fewer numbers than normal. The seven-day average as of Sunday was 871,513, or 35.6% of the equivalent week last year. The overall passenger deficit since March is enormous. Airlines’ loads fell by more than 417 million passengers since the virus hit compared to the same period in 2019, a drop of about 75%, according to the TSA."

Instead of quaranting at home for 10 days, passengers returning to England from destinations on the government’s “amber list” will be told to take a Covid test two days after arrival, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Thursday in a statement to the U.K. Parliament. The new rules take effect on July 19. Those under 18 who are not currently vaccinated will also be exempted from the restrictions on movement once they’ve returned, making it easier for British families to go on holiday, Shapps said. “Many people have not been able to travel for the last year and a half,” said Shapps. The move is aimed at “reuniting families who have been apart through this pandemic, helping businesses to trade and grow, and supporting aviation, a sector which hundreds of thousands of jobs rely on.” For now, the measures apply only to returning U.K. residents. The government plans to extend the approach to visitors from major markets including the U.S. and European Union later this summer, he said. The relaxing of the rules will come into force in time for England’s school holidays, offering a boost to the ailing travel industry which has struggled with lockdowns and closed borders for more than a year. “It will make a hell of a difference,” Jozsef Varadi, chief executive officer of discount carrier Wizz Air Holdings Plc, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “The moment these restrictions are relaxed there is a boost and people take advantage of every opportunity arising.” Shares of airline companies rose off of earlier lows, with U.K. discounter EasyJet Plc and British Airways owner IAG SA turning positive. Ryanair Holdings Plc, Europe’s biggest low-cost carrier, slipped amid mounting concern about an increase in Covid cases across Europe. U.K. Is Easing Covid Rules, Bringing Businesses Fresh Concerns Under existing rules on foreign travel, visitors to more than 100 destinations, including the vital U.S. market and some of the most popular European destinations, are required to isolate for 10 days on their return to the U.K. In the hours following the announcement, traffic from U.K. travelers to Skyscanner Ltd. increased by 53%, according to the travel-booking website. Many of these destinations are on the government’s “amber list,” rated as medium risk for coronavirus. Travelers to these places who have had their second coronavirus shot more than 14 days earlier will be able to avoid isolation. The changes don’t apply to returnees from high-risk red listed countries. The government currently advises Britons not to travel to both categories of destination, but this guidance will be removed for amber-list locations, Shapps said. Only a handful of countries are judged to be safe enough to be put on the green list. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his team are grappling with how best to reopen the economy now that 65% of U.K. adults have received both doses of Covid vaccines. Yet even as the rollout of shots continues, a surge in infections from the delta variant is complicating the government’s efforts to lift restrictions. On Wednesday, 32,548 people tested positive for Covid-19, and another 33 deaths were recorded. Officials have suggested that infections could be running as high as 100,000 new cases a day later this summer. While most pandemic restrictions within England will end July 19, the requirement to isolate if a person has been in contact with a positive case will continue until Aug. 16. That delay to ending the isolation requirement for “close contacts” has fueled concern that millions of people will be forced to stay at home, damaging efforts to reopen businesses. On Wednesday, Johnson defended his policy on self-isolation, saying the government needed to “balance” the risks. “This is a highly contagious disease. We have to do what we can to stop its spread,” he said. Travel groups cautioned that despite the progress on external trips, expensive tests and other requirements could still act as a damper on demand. “As always, the devil is in the detail,” said Virginia Messina, senior vice president of the World Travel and Tourism Council. “There could well be some people who get caught out by the myriad of complicated rules and regulations which could scupper their much-needed summer holidays.” Despite the quibbles, the change is a step toward the “genuine reopening” for the airline sector, said Tim Alderslade, CEO of industry body Airlines U.K. “We now urge the Government to continue this momentum by adding many more countries to the green list next week,” he said, “‘and removing onerous testing requirements at its next review on 31 July.”"

The FTSE 250 index of mid-cap U.K. shares jumped as much as 1.4%, paring its gains to 0.2% by 11:18 a.m. in London, after Johnson pledged to ease lockdown rules in stages over the next four months, including the possibility of international trips restarting as soon as May 17. The outperformance was especially pronounced as the European benchmark Stoxx 600 fell 1.2%. The news brought relief for cyclical and domestically oriented companies that have been suffering during the past year of the pandemic as lockdowns weighed on economic growth and consumer spending. Johnson is facing pressure to move faster in his reopening plans after the economy endured its deepest recession in more than 300 years. “The news will be the light at the end of the tunnel for the services side of the economy, where the restrictions on close-contact industries have been devastating,” said Oliver Blackbourn, a multi-asset portfolio manager at Janus Henderson. EasyJet Plc rose as much as 12% after ticket sales more than quadrupled in the hours after Johnson outlined a roadmap for a return to air travel. Wizz Air Holdings Plc jumped as much as 5.9% while Ryanair Holdings Plc also advanced. U.K.’s Vaccine Milestone Ignites World-Beating Market Rally Retailer WH Smith Plc, which operates stores in airports and train stations, was up as much as 8.2%, while hotel and restaurant chain owner Whitbread Plc climbed as much as 4.9%. SSP Group Plc, which offers catering and concession services, jumped as much as 22%. “We are seeing a sharp acceleration in the reopening trade,” said Karim Moussalem, head of cash equities at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe in London. Within travel and leisure, “it’s pretty clear that some panic buying is occurring,” he said by phone. The prospect of the economy’s reopening and acceleration of the vaccination program are bringing more fans to equities in the U.K., which according to Bank of America Corp.’s fund manager survey is the world’s biggest underweight stock market. BlackRock Investment Institute’s strategists debuted an overweight call on U.K. equities this week, saying that the evaporation of uncertainty over a Brexit deal should remove the risk premium from U.K. assets. They also favor U.K. large caps as an “attractive play” on the global cyclical recovery."

It’ll take until 2024 for international air travel across the region to reach pre-virus levels, a year after global traffic hits that milestone, according to the International Air Transport Association. Similarly, consultancy Energy Aspects says jet fuel consumption will reach pre-pandemic volumes only in 2023-2024. The drawn-out timelines highlight the difficulties facing Asia and the likely consequences for jet fuel, a traditionally prized part of the oil-products market. Low rates of vaccination in many countries, the challenge posed by the fast-spreading delta variant, and persistent lockdowns have all set back the recovery even as the U.S. and Europe press on. All that means Asia’s aviation industry is unlikely to offer significant support to the region’s hard-pressed refineries, which process crude from the Middle East and elsewhere into fuels. Both North America and Europe have seen strong demand during the holidays, with the European Union relaxing quarantine and lockdown requirements, according to Mayur Patel, regional sales director for Japan and Asia Pacific at OAG, an aviation analytics firm. “Sadly, the same cannot be said for Asia, where the low level of vaccination rates, sudden and sharp lockdowns, and inconsistent regulations frustrate any real attempt at a recovery,” he said. Just this week, Indonesia -- the largest economy in Southeast Asia -- surpassed India’s tally of daily cases, marking a new center for the highly-contagious delta variant. Elsewhere, Malaysia has been struggling to contain a recent outbreak, Seoul in South Korea has imposed its toughest restrictions yet, and Japan is preparing to host the Olympic Games without spectators. While there have been signs some countries including Singapore are rethinking their Covid-zero stance to open up, it’s likely international travel will still take longer than the rest of the world to restart. Australia’s plan to launch a quarantine-free travel bubble with the city-state is now more likely to occur only by the end of the year, according to an Australian diplomat. “We expect passenger traffic for international Asia-Pacific to restart in early 2022 at the earliest,” an IATA spokesperson said in an email interview. “We don’t think that the variant situation will improve, so governments are unlikely to start lifting controls before vaccination becomes sufficiently widespread to limit community contagion.” That means a longer struggle for Asian refiners. Given the differentiated recovery, some processors have been looking to Europe and the U.S. as outlets for jet fuel, shipping more to both regions. With lackluster demand, the margin for making jet fuel in Asia was $5.75 a barrel at 2:23pm in Singapore, compared with $15.54 in December 2019, Bloomberg Fair Value data show. Asia’s jet fuel usage accounted for a third of global consumption in 2019, according to Energy Aspects. Right now, the region’s overall flight numbers -- domestic and international -- are 70% of pre-virus levels, but if China is excluded are only 40%, according to George Dix, an analyst. “We currently expect Asian jet demand will not reach pre-pandemic levels until 2023-2024, although domestic travel will have largely recovered by the end of 2022.” Given the challenges, regional refiners will continue to redirect kerosene, which includes jet fuel, into the gasoil pool this quarter, aiming to tap into winter fuel heating demand the following quarter, according to Sri Paravaikkarasu at energy consultancy FGE. “The full recovery of international air travel has a long way to go,” she said.

The European planemaker rode a December flurry of jet deliveries to beat its target to break even for a second straight quarter, based on adjusted free cash flow.

U.K. Airlines Urge Johnson to Lay Out Path for Travel Reopening The company’s downbeat outlook for this year surprised analysts who had expected Airbus to target higher aircraft deliveries after successfully balancing demand with output in the final months of 2020. The assessment reflects uncertainty over when the “tipping point” for a travel rebound will come, Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury said on a conference call. “We can see progress on vaccination campaigns but new variants of the virus are spreading, and at the same time we see reinforced lockdowns,” Faury said. “The pace of recovery will not only depend on the evolution of the pandemic and rate and effectiveness of vaccines, but also the reaction of governments.” The uncertain outlook confirms Airbus has yet to break free from the Covid-19 crisis that’s pummeled manufacturers and airlines alike for the past year. Air travel remains challenging, with countries tightening borders despite vaccine rollouts. Since January, when the planemaker slowed a plan to increase output, customers have pared back flight schedules and dragged out aircraft deliveries further. Airbus shares fell as much as 4.6%, and were down 3.4% to 90.67 euros as of 12:24 p.m. in Paris. The Toulouse, France-based company reported earnings before interest and taxes of 1.83 billion euros for the fourth quarter, a 35% drop, as revenue slid 19% to 19.8 billion euros. Airbus expects jet handovers this year to at least match the 566 delivered in 2020, Faury said. The goal for adjusted free cash flow -- which excludes the impact of M&A and customer financing -- is breakeven, while EBIT is forecast at 2 billion euros, according to a statement Thursday. Airbus said last month that output of its top-selling A320-series narrow-body will rise gradually to 45 per month through the fourth quarter. It had previously targeted a faster jump, to 47 monthly by July from the current rate of 40 planes. Faury told Bloomberg Television that the guidance on deliveries reflects the very uncertain environment and the difficult start to the year. The company could beat these forecasts if the outlook improves, he said. While case counts are coming down, new virus strains have created uncertainty about the timing of a global travel recovery. Passenger traffic may improve by only 13% in 2021 in a worst-case scenario, the International Air Transport Association said this month. That compares with an official forecast of a 50% rebound issued in December. The CEO said on the conference call that the company currently has fewer than than 100 undelivered aircraft, including a “small number” of white-tails, or jets without a customer. He reiterated his expectation that the commercial-aircaft market won’t return to pre-Covid levels until sometime between 2023 and 2025. In the meantime, airlines’ shaky finances will ripple back to Airbus. The planemaker’s cash flows will feel the impact from lower pre-delivery payments from customers, as well as a greater requirement to help finance plane purchases, Chief Financial Officer Dominik Asam said on the call. The company may be required to finance 1 billion euros or more for its customers, though it hopes export credit programs will help to fill the gap. “It’s not our intention to do more than we need to do,” Asam said. “We’re not a bank, we’re an aircraft manufacturer.” The value of Airbus’s order backlog fell by 98 billion euros to 373 billion euros at year-end, reflecting in part the longer-term damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic on the health of the aerospace industry. Around 10% of the drop in value is down to cancellations and the coronavirus impact on the backlog, Faury said. The company relies heavily on the Asia-Pacific region for deliveries, with almost 30% of its order backlog in the region, while another 30% is for European customers and 21% destined for North America."

Mike Dunleavy has offered COVID-19 vaccines to residents of the small British Columbia town of Stewart, with hopes it could lead the Canadian government to ease restrictions between Stewart and the tiny Alaska border community of Hyder a couple miles away. “Our neighbors to the east are fantastic. We couldn’t ask for better neighbors than the Canadians. But the virus has really hit them hard and as a result, their mitigating approaches have affected us greatly by slowing down traffic, limiting traffic,” Dunleavy told The Associated Press as he ended a long day of travel across southeast Alaska late last week. The trip included travel from Ketchikan to Hyder on a float plane that held seven people, including the pilot. The AP was the only news organization traveling with Dunleavy and got a first-hand look at the Republican governor as he met with local leaders and residents in Ketchikan, Hyder and Metlakatla, the only Indian reserve in Alaska, to hear how they have been impacted by the pandemic and about their top priorities and concerns. Hyder and Stewart are closely linked. Hyder residents get gas and groceries in Stewart, and kids from Hyder go to school there. Hyder even shares an area code with its Canadian neighbor and runs on Pacific time, an hour ahead of most of the rest of Alaska. Stewart has around 400 residents. Hyder, with an estimated population of nearly 70, flies a banner declaring itself “the friendliest ghost town in Alaska.” Dunleavy referred to Hyder and Stewart as “one community in two countries.” With COVID-19, travel in Canada has been restricted to essential business. Hyder residents say they can't visit the homes of friends in Stewart, and Stewart Mayor Gina McKay said her residents are largely restricted from going to Hyder, including for recreational activities they were accustomed to, such as snowmobile riding and using Hyder’s boat launch to fish. “It's been tough on both sides,” she said. Hyder is the only community in Alaska’s southernmost reaches accessible by road — a road that runs through Stewart. Hyder, at the head of a fjord, has a dock for float planes, but air travel can be limited by weather conditions. Dunleavy said he invited the state's chief medical officer, Dr. Anne Zink, “on the spur of the moment” to accompany him Thursday and offer vaccines not only to Hyder residents who had not yet been vaccinated but also to people from Stewart. He said he reasoned that, because the state has an adequate vaccine supply, “why not share it with them and try to get them vaccinated?” In March, Alaska was the first state to fully open eligibility for vaccines and allow anyone 16 or older who lives or works in the state to get a vaccine. Dunleavy, seeking to revive a state tourism industry battered by the pandemic, recently announced travelers could get vaccines at some Alaska airports starting June 1. McKay said many Stewart residents received a first vaccine dose during a weeklong clinic in Stewart around Easter but the wait time for a second dose is up to four months. British Columbia health officials said the approach is intended to make the most of a limited vaccine supply and allow more people to get first doses. In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine three weeks after a first dose and a second dose of the Moderna vaccine four weeks after a first dose. Both are widely used in Alaska and among the vaccines used in Canada. Zink said 19 people from Canada, most from Stewart, got shots Thursday in Hyder and one person from Hyder did. Zink administered the vaccines in a parking lot outside a community building given the warm, sunny weather. Some of the other Canadians who received vaccines were working in the area. She said Stewart is “pretty well vaccinated,” and that the clinic there said it would send over people who were interested but not yet vaccinated. She said she thinks those were among the people who showed up Thursday. Most of the shots given Thursday were first doses, Zink said. There are plans to work with state public health nurses to return to the area and Zink said they could bring additional second doses so that if anyone in Stewart wanted a second dose at that time, they could get one. Dunleavy said he hopes that as more people get vaccinated “then maybe just maybe there’s a possibility that those two small communities that are really one can get back together and get back to living life as normal.” McKay, who met with Dunleavy, a state senator and interested Hyder residents on a dusty section of road at the border, called the state's offer to share vaccines incredible. If Stewart residents could get second doses that way, it could free up doses for others in British Columbia, she said. But McKay said she's not sure how soon the Canadian federal government might ease any travel restrictions. She said as restrictions have persisted, “I'm starting to forget what normal was like and worrying that this is the new normal.”"

Leaders in the U.K. and Ireland are focused on the wrong data with the daily coronavirus case rate and should put more effort toward test-and-trace programs to get the economy moving, the outspoken airline chief said Tuesday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. He also slammed British quarantine measures and the “chopping and changing of requirements” in London. “It’s largely political mismanagement,” O’Leary said. “The Germans and the Italians are much more effective.” Airline hopes for a summer rebound were dashed by rising virus cases and shifting restrictions, often brought about with little notice. It’s disrupted trips and dimmed the public’s appetite to go abroad. Dublin-based Ryanair and other carriers have pulled back on schedules and are resorting to more cost cuts and fundraising to get through the quieter winter season. “The government’s got to come up with some measures here to give the airlines and the airline industry a break this winter,” O’Leary said, repeating an industry call for lower U.K. passenger duties. The U.K. government has downplayed the benefits of introducing testing at airports, saying a lengthy quarantine would still be required. It has zig-zagged between stimulatory moves like encouraging people to go to offices, restaurants and pubs, and limiting public gatherings to fight the disease’s spread. Read: Boris Johnson Bans Gatherings of More Than Six to Fight Covid Continuing to require arrivals to self-isolate will hurt business travel through fall, O’Leary said. While people are still traveling, largely for family events such as christenings or weddings, “there’s a degree of nervousness there,” he said. “That’s what we need the government to address.”"

Quarantine-free flights were originally meant to start last November, but the plan was postponed after an outbreak in Hong Kong. It was resurrected five months later and the first trips are scheduled for May 26. Relatives and friends are on the cusp of long-awaited reunions, but their hopes could still be dashed. Selena Wu is one of many on tenterhooks. The 40-year-old, originally from Singapore, lives in Hong Kong and has seats on a June 1 bubble flight back to the city-state with her husband and three children. She plans to stay for six weeks, spending time with family. “It will be the first visit since February last year,” said Wu, who along with her husband is fully vaccinated. Her parents plan to take the kids to Singapore’s famous night safari, but Wu worries if they’ll be able to fly there at all. “It’s so sad. Every night, we’re praying that the travel bubble will still persist.” The corridor linking two of Asia’s most important cities reflects the fragility of reopening efforts given the spread of new variants and vaccination in the region that lags the U.S and Europe. Both Singapore and Hong Kong have suppressed local transmission to very low levels and face pressure to maintain that success amid attempts to revive their travel-reliant economies. Visitors from Hong Kong, if they do come, will experience a Singapore that’s recently tightened restrictions once again. A growing cluster linked to a large public hospital has triggered a three-week crackdown, including limiting social gatherings to no more than five people and restraining border movements to stem the spread of the new variant first identified in India. While barbecue pits, gyms and campsites are closed, restaurants are open and in most cases, busy. Patrons must however finish drinking by around 10pm. Operating capacity for attractions like museums and public libraries has been scaled back to 50%, tour groups capped at 20 people, and the use of Singapore’s TraceTogether app, which must be scanned to enter everything from supermarkets, shops, malls and eateries, will be mandatory from May 17. Singapore is working hard to contain the latest outbreak lest it threaten the World Economic Forum, which it is due to host in August, and the Shangri-La Dialogue, set to start on June 4. Government agencies have stepped up enforcement, penalizing businesses and individuals for breaching safety measures. An open house for the public to visit the president’s official residence next week has been canceled. A spokeswoman for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which is organizing the Shangri-La event, said the body is “monitoring developments in Singapore, as well as the global Covid-19 situation. We continue to work in close partnership with the government of Singapore to ensure the highest levels of safety for participants.” A Ministry of Trade and Industry spokesperson said specific plans will be worked out with the World Economic Forum and the Singapore government will implement “strict public health requirements and safe management measures that attendees will have to comply with.” According to the terms of the agreement, the travel bubble will be closed for two weeks if the seven-day moving average of the daily number of unlinked local cases is more than five in either city. The number in Singapore stands at 1.43, well below that threshold. The Ministry of Health said it found only one case of locally-transmitted infection on Wednesday. The Hong Kong government is watching the outbreak in Singapore, where the number of cases is “by and large” within the agreed range, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau said late Tuesday. Shares in Singapore Airlines Ltd. closed down 3% Wednesday, their biggest loss since April 19, while Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. fell 1.8%. Wu, whose parents were supposed to come to Hong Kong in November before the bubble was called off initially, is hoping this will be second time lucky. “If everyone cooperates and they’re aggressive with their quarantining and contract tracing, I think it’s possible to contain an outbreak within a few weeks because we’ve seen that in Hong Kong,” she said. “Hopefully it will be contained.”"

Now consider doing it at the tail end of a global pandemic that’s upended airlines’ flight schedules, closed international borders and made any movement without jabs and multiple Covid tests impossible. For hundreds of Olympic organizing officials eyeing the start of the Tokyo Games in just 18 days it’s a major headache. Forget about medal tallies and post-race parties (to the limited extent they’re permitted at all), just getting to Japan on time is half the battle. WATCH: With 3 weeks to go until the Olympics, rising Covid-19 infections and getting athletes to Japan is looking like a logistical nightmare. Source: Quicktake The Fijian team gathers in a huddle during the Oceania Sevens Challenge in Townsville, Australia on June 26. Other teams are finding they have to travel thousands of miles in the wrong direction before making their way to Japan. Under normal circumstances, the Sri Lankan team would have taken a flight to Singapore and from there onto Tokyo. But with Covid cases still averaging almost 2,000 a day, Sri Lanka, an island to the south of India, is on many countries’ banned lists. Singapore doesn’t allow anyone with a recent travel history to even transit through the city-state. As a result, the 10-strong team across disciplines including badminton, judo and archery, is booked on Qatar Airways via Doha, according to National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka President Suresh Subramaniam. They’ve got a back-up flight on SriLankan Airlines in case the situation changes. “I hope and pray nobody falls ill once we go to Japan,” Subramaniam said. “We’ve got an extra doctor flying with us this time to look after any Covid issues. We’re taking every precaution.” Although most athletes have been fully vaccinated and Games organizers require negative Covid tests prior to arrival, there have already been some upsets. Two members of Uganda’s Olympic squad tested positive in Japan last month, despite having been inoculated earlier, and over the weekend, a rower from Serbia tested positive. Even the fastest woman alive can’t avoid all the logistical hurdles along the road to this year’s extraordinary Olympics, which will be held with no international spectators and strict social-distancing measures that include rules around how many hours after their race athletes must leave the Village. Jamaican sprinter Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, the odds-on favorite for the women’s 100 meters, faces a labyrinth of connecting flights, layovers and paperwork just to get to Tokyo. “I have a Jamaican passport so it’s even more difficult for me to travel,” the two-time Olympic champion said. Ugandan atthletes arrive at Narita International Airport in Japan on June 19. For the 34-old-sprinter, the trip is a more than 8,000 mile journey. Fraser-Pryce anticipates she will travel from her home in Kingston to Miami, then on to London to catch a connecting flight bound for Tokyo. Because the pandemic has elevated fares, the cheapest flight from Kingston to Tokyo on economy runs to nearly $5,000 on Expedia.com The Brazilian delegation, meanwhile -- a large group of almost 300 athletes competing in events from fencing to skateboarding, shooting, swimming and gymnastics -- had to scramble to get flights on Deutsche Lufthansa AG after its original carrier Air Canada canceled flights that would have taken the team via Toronto. “Due to the pandemic, we had to make some necessary changes that demanded creativity,” Brazilian Olympic Committee President Paulo Wanderley Teixeira said, adding that even getting the sporting equipment to Tokyo has been a “true war operation.” Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, center, in the Women’s 100m final during the Diamond League athletics meeting in Doha, Qatar on May 28. “We also had a few surprises regarding airline tickets. For example, we had a contract with an airline and had already paid 80%, but they changed their route and canceled,” Teixeria said. Flying Lufthansa via Frankfurt is more costly but at least the team is able to pick up some of its athletes who happen to be training in Europe en-route, he said. Another particular logistics problem of holding the Games during a pandemic has been that many athletes haven’t been able to train in locations they would have normally otherwise. Difficulty traveling internationally has also made getting to the necessary qualifying events extremely tricky. Jamaica’s track team would typically have trained and competed in Europe for a few weeks before the Games. An earlier plan to train in Tottori, about 400 miles west of Tokyo, was also scrapped, according to Fraser-Pryce. That means she’ll get less time to work out the passing of the baton to other teammates in the relay. The Brazilian team’s sports equipment en route to Tokyo, in Rio de Janeiro on May 4.

He and his crew mate Cecilia Carranza Saroli are now in Barcelona, waiting for their flight to Tokyo later this week. “We normally have at least 90 days to get to know the conditions, and now we’ll have only eight. Those eight days for our particular sport are not enough,” said Lange, who wasn’t able to sail in Argentina for several months due to Covid restrictions last year. In the pair’s rented house in Sicily, they put up pictures of Mount Fuji to stay mentally connected. “In normal circumstances, we’d compete in at least 10 competitions a year. We did only two last year,” he said. The Australian national softball team practices in Ota, Gunma prefecture on June 15. And of course, as athletes in far-flung places that aren’t international hubs check their luggage and boarding passes one last time, the virus that has laid waste to so many lives, hopes and dreams is never far from their thoughts. “We usually think of the race,” said Selemon Barega, an Ethiopian long-distance runner who competes primarily in the 5,000 meters. “But now the fear of the virus is also running in our minds.” The team from Fiji, a tiny South Pacific island nation best known for its pristine beaches and tropical seas, isn’t flying coach so much as cargo -- the Rugby Sevens mens and womens, plus a handful of other athletes including some swimmers and sailors, are flying from Nadi to Narita on a service that generally transports chilled seafood like tuna and mahi mahi, and express mail. “Travel is definitely a major challenge,” said Lorraine Mar, head of the Fiji Association of Sports and National Olympic Committee. “Fiji Airways isn’t doing any commercial flights at the current time so we’re going up on a cargo run.” Mar said Fiji was trying to coordinate with other South Pacific nations to “do a milk run around the other islands to to collect everyone, but it wasn’t commercially viable.” Papua New Guinea’s team plans to fly to Brisbane and then onto Tokyo while Samoa’s squad will likely go first to Auckland and then fly Air New Zealand, she said."

Commodity, financial and industrial shares led losses in the S&P 500, which fell the most in two months.

Ten-year yields tumbled as much 12 basis points to as little as 1.17%. The dollar rose alongside the yen and the Swiss franc. Despite the classic safety trade, gold retreated. Oil sank after OPEC+ agreed to boost supply into 2022. Meantime, Bitcoin’s slide pushed the world’s largest digital currency closer to $30,000. The resurgence of Covid-19 is unsettling global investors, who are considering whether new lockdown restrictions will sap the economic rebound and reverse an equity rally that had driven stocks to a record. Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, told Bloomberg Television that the move to “higher-quality assets” such as Treasuries is justified. Americans should avoid traveling to the U.K. because of a surge in that nation’s spread of Covid-19, U.S. government and health officials warned. “Risk aversion is firmly in place as the Delta Covid variant spread is triggering a flight to safety,” wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “Equities were ripe for a pullback given Wall Street was in agreement that this is ‘as good as it gets’ for peak earnings, economic growth, monetary stimulus. It is hard to hold risky assets over the short-term now.” Geopolitical jitters also resurfaced on Monday after the U.S., the U.K. and their allies said the Chinese government has been the mastermind behind a series of malicious ransomware, data theft and cyber-espionage attacks against public and private entities -- including the sprawling Microsoft Exchange hack earlier this year.

Leslie Cofresí at La Factoría wants to shake up the cocktail world.  Source: La Factoria Since it opened in 2013 in San Juan, La Factoría has been unquestionably the best bar in Puerto Rico. One of the best anywhere, in fact, a perennial entry in the World’s Best Bars list.  It’s also one of the loneliest.  La Factoría suffers from a problem shared by Beirut’s Electric Bing Sutt, Cartagena’s Alquímico, Delhi’s Sidecar, Lima’s Carnaval, Stockholm’s Tjoget, and Tel Aviv’s Imperial—being the only top-tier game in town. The lack of competition means these places are seen as spots for special occasions. They rarely break into the normalcy of a packed Wednesday night; weekends and holidays as a business strategy can only take a business so far. Leslie Cofresí, a La Factoría partner who has become its public face, has developed a solution to his solitude, shaking up cocktail economics in the process. After years of being San Juan’s go-to bartender for mixology events, Cofresí has leveraged supplier relationships into a business, Licorería Miramar. It’s a commissary-style warehouse at which he and his Colectivo Icaro partners sell juices, garnishes, and craft ice at scale—not just for La Factoría, but for 20 clients that include the local Ritz-Carlton and Caribe Hilton (birthplace of the piña colada). Cofresí says Licorería handles the entire cocktail program for four clients, designing cocktails for the menu and supplying inventory. The idea represents a pivot within high-end mixology, taking it from a niche, bar-by-bar program to a full-blown market that could reshape a city’s nightlife fortunes. Consultancies, such as Proprietors LLC from the founders of  Death & Co., have existed for years in the industry but are almost wholly focused on bars’ debuts—not their later development. “There comes a point where the cost of an apparently simple thing, multiplied by the volume needed, brings to light a series of hidden costs that aren’t normally considered when scale is not a factor,” says Cofresí. For prep work and mise-en-place, Licorería is akin to the cocktail industry’s version of Blue Apron—for instance, supplying ready-to-use citrus garnishes.  “The process of growing a business requires letting go of micromanaging a lot of simple things to focus resources on the things that really push growth,” he continues. That many top-tier bartenders have notorious egos and wouldn’t warm to a plug-and-play solution is an issue Licorería sidesteps by focusing on new growth. Put plainly, high-end mixology’s artfulness has become impractical. What starter bar can afford a $800 centrifuge for clarifying juices or a $300 sous vide machine for optimal simple syrup—let alone train its staff on the gizmos? That’s money and time thrown into long-term prospects instead of short-term profits. Even simple tasks can weigh on ledgers. Consider more efficient uses for a $15 an hour worker than slicing fruit that’s merely a drink accoutrement. Or the time lost in constantly reevaluating suppliers to see if their prices have changed since the last delivery. Take limes: Cofresí says a case of the citrus varies from $38 to $65, spiking as high as $80 recently. By contrast, Licorería has locked in the price of a quart of lime juice at $19—the year-round average, according to Cofresí. “It’s a cheat sheet,” says Micah Melton, beverage director of Chicago’s Alinea Group and the influential Aviary bar. “Leslie’s giving an NFL playbook to high school teams, so off the bat you’re set up for success.” He continues: “It’s a great way to kickstart an overall cocktail city. You need that framework of four or five places, a culture of beverage. An operation like that helps jumpstart citywide culture.”  Not that the idea is without risk. “This only works if the person is doing the right thing well,” says Don Lee, a New York titan of avant-garde mixology who ran the apprentice program at Tales of the Cocktail, the world’s biggest bartending conference. He notes that if one thing is spoiled, it will be spoiled at multiple bars instead of just one. “What’s the acceptable risk?” he adds. “Even if I’m doing everything right, how do I trust they’ll receive the stuff I’m giving them correctly? Refrigerate it properly? I wouldn’t trust that.”  Undeterred, Cofresí is planning expansions that include using product from Licorería’s own farms—such staples as ginger, mint, and passion fruit, as well as citrus—for end-to-end control. He calls it “farm to shaker.” Regional operations in Colombia and the Dominican Republic are next.  The Aviary’s Melton believes the pandemic-recovery timing is right. “You have this golden opportunity to change the norm and adjust and adapt your business models,” he says. “A new normal for a new clientele.”"

His comment Friday suggests the government is getting close to delivering on industry-specific funding it first pledged in March, as it shut down large swathes of the economy in response to the pandemic. Justin Trudeau. “The details are still very much under discussion and in reflection,” the prime minister said at an Ottawa news conference, when asked about a Globe and Mail report his cabinet is weighing an airline bailout package. “There are certain industries that are harder hit than others because of this pandemic. Travel and tourism is certainly one of them,” Trudeau said, promising he’d work “to ensure that we’re going to have a strong airline industry coming back.” Carriers like Air Canada and WestJet Airlines Ltd. have been racing to cut costs by eliminating unprofitable routes and shedding workers. The moves have left Atlantic Canada in the lurch, which could prompt the government to attach strings to any funding, according to the Globe. “My largest preoccupation is always going to be for Canadians themselves for workers and for people in rural and remote -- and not even so rural and remote regions, like Atlantic Canada -- that are seeing significant reductions in airline service,” Trudeau said. A stipulation that government funding not be used to compensate executive is also under consideration, the newspaper said Friday morning, citing an anonymous government official and three unnamed industry sources. The money would come through low-interest loans and rollbacks of airport fee increases, the Globe said, adding the package could be announced in a budget update expected next month. Industry leaders have been pressing Trudeau for months to deliver an aid package, or at least loosen travel restrictions to allow tourists into Canada. The government has yet to act despite former Finance Minister Bill Morneau’s promise in March of rapid relief for airlines and other hard-hit sectors. Trudeau said airlines have already received over a C$1 billion ($761 million) in direct aid through programs such as the government’s wage subsidy, which covers up to 75% of employee pay. Separately Friday, Statistics Canada began to put a price tag on pandemic travel restrictions. The moves could cost the country between 400,000 and 500,000 jobs and shave off as much as 1.7% from total economic output this year, the agency said in a study. "

Startup carrier Norse Atlantic Airways began a 1.28 billion-krone ($150 million) share placement to bankroll the launch of trans-Atlantic flights this year even as air travel remains mired in its worst-ever slump. Shipping entrepreneur Bjorn Tore Larsen, Norse’s chief executive, will subscribe for stock worth the equivalent of $10 million, while $64 million has been allocated to six backers including Handelsbanken, DNB Asset Management and Nordea Investment Management, according to a filing Tuesday. Following the private sale at 20 kroner a share the airline plans to list on the Oslo Stock Exchange in mid-April. Norse, founded by executives with ties to Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, is aiming to fill a gap in the market created when the discount specialist filed for insolvency. It’s betting that cut-price fares will stir up demand on trans-Atlantic flights once travel curbs are lifted. Proceeds from the share sale will provide working capital and fund lease deposits on as many as 12 Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner aircraft previously used by Norwegian. The placing is the second by a new airline in Norway in barely more than a matter of weeks after short-haul startup Flyr AS raised 600 million kroner, backed by investors that again included Nordea. Flyr, which aims to begin flying in the first half, traded at 4.2 kroner as of 10:50 a.m. in Oslo, slightly down on its 5 kroner placing price on March 1. Norse is targeting a December introduction of services linking U.S. cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Miami with London, Paris and Oslo, with further expansion to add destinations in Asia. Larsen has said the company will stick to routes that are popular and profitable. That may be a challenge under its current launch timetable as new waves of Covid-19 prompt further lockdowns and prompt governments to review plans for reopening travel. Arctic Securities AS, Pareto Securities AS and SpareBank 1 Markets AS have been appointed to manage the placement."

He said that social media networks are “killing people” by allowing the spread of misinformation about vaccines. The governor of Louisiana, one of the least-vaccinated states, said it was time to “run, not walk” to get a shot. Biden signaled progress toward lifting a ban on travel from Europe, raising hopes for a reopening of the almost $40 billion North Atlantic air corridor 16 months after the pandemic grounded flights. President Joe Biden said Friday that social media networks are “killing people” by allowing the spread of misinformation about coronavirus vaccines. “Look, the only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated,” Biden said after he was asked about his message for tech companies as he departed the White House on Friday. “And they’re killing people.” Biden’s comments come after the White House earlier this week called on social media networks to do more to purge posts carrying incorrect information about the pandemic, or discouraging readers from taking vaccines that can largely eliminate the risk of a deadly outcome from coronavirus. New Jersey’s transmission rate hit 1.24, highest since the week of the Thanksgiving holiday in November, when the state was deep into a second wave. Hospital patient counts, meanwhile, have remained steady for a month, at just over 300 per day. A transmission rate above 1 indicates that Covid-19 is spreading. On Nov. 23, when New Jersey reported a 1.27 rate, the state had 2,785 hospitalizations and 48 deaths. The state health department reported 516 cases, the most since May 21, and two new lab-confirmed deaths. The fast-spreading delta variant has accounted for 41% of New Jersey cases in the past four weeks, state data show. Almost 5 million residents, more than half the state’s population, has been fully vaccinated. Quebec, the Canadian province that suffered the most deaths from Covid-19, is resorting to cash and scholarships to boost its vaccination rates and weather the rise of variants. After endorsing the idea of vaccine passports last week, the provincial government is going for a reward approach that has been used in the U.S. and elsewhere. Authorities said Friday they’re launching a lottery for vaccinated residents next month with C$2 million ($1.6 million) worth of prizes, including C$400,000 in scholarships for kids from 12 to 18. One or two jabs will be required, depending on the draw. “We’re doing all this to avoid hospitalizations if cases start going up in the fall,” Health Minister Christian Dube said during a news conference. Illinois’s Covid-19 cases jumped 51% in the past week, according to data from the state’s department of public health. The state added 4,449 new confirmed and probable cases, up from 2,945 a week earlier. Weekly deaths climbed to 62 from 53. At least one vaccine dose has been given to 73% of Illinois adults and more than 57% are fully vaccinated, the department said Friday. France reported the highest increase in daily infections since May 28 with 10,908 new cases. The amount is nearly twice as much as the seven-day average but is just a fraction of this year’s peak in early April with 84,999 cases. France registered on Friday 22 additional coronavirus-related deaths over the past 24 hours, bringing the official toll to 111,451. New infections increased in every U.S. state except Michigan during the week through Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Florida led increases among “high transmission” states with a 109% jump, followed by Arkansas, Nevada and Missouri. Jacksonville, Florida, and Las Vegas recorded the highest positive-test ratios among urban areas with more than 1 million inhabitants during the week through Monday. Hospital admissions for Covid-19 increased 54% in Jacksonville, with Miami, Orlando, Florida, and San Antonio, Texas, reporting rises of 53%. Austin, Texas, Nashville, Tennessee, and Milwaukee led major metro areas with an increasing Covid burden as measured by the upward curve in new cases, according to the CDC report published Friday. With deaths and hospitalizations from Covid-19 on the rise, the U.S. is seeing a “pandemic of the unvaccinated” in parts of the country where inoculation rates are low, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. While Covid cases have fallen dramatically since the introduction of vaccines, the seven-day average of new infections is now up 70% from the previous week, with 26,300 new infections a day, CDC Chief Rochelle Walensky said at a White House briefing on Friday. The agency’s biggest concern given the falling pace of shots is that the agency will continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations and deaths, she said. Just four states accounted for 40% of Covid cases in the past week, said Jeffrey Zients, President Joe Biden’s Covid-19 response coordinator, with 1 in 5 cases occurring in Florida alone. The 7-day average of hospital admissions nationwide rose 36% to 2,790 while daily deaths jumped 26% to 211 per day. Governor John Bel Edwards said Louisianans need to “run, not walk” to get vaccinated as the delta variant has pushed cases up almost 200% over last two weeks. He also said the state was in a “fourth surge.” “Our hospitals are again stretched thin with limited staff capacity, and the vast majority of Covid patients are not yet fully vaccinated against the illness,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. Louisiana has one of the lowest rates of vaccination in the U.S., with 39.5% of the population having received at least one dose compared with the national average of 55.8%, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. Only Alabama and Mississippi are lower. Pfizer Inc. said its vaccine was granted priority review by U.S. regulators, putting it on track for a potential full approval by early next year. The drugmaker and its German partner BioNTech SE said in a statement Friday that the Food and Drug Administration plans to decide whether to approve the shot for use in people 16 and older by January 2022. A full approval for the Pfizer vaccine could help bolster the flagging U.S. vaccination effort. Some people who have been reluctant to get a shot have said they are unwilling to get an experimental medication. The delta variant is expected to become dominant in Italy in the next few weeks, Silvio Brusaferro, president of the country’s public health institute, said in a press conference on Friday. “The general scenario, in terms of transmission of the infection, is worsening,” he said. “So the priority now is to have as many people as possible fully vaccinated.” As of July 9, the delta variant made up almost 28% of samples tested. U.S. President Joe Biden signaled progress toward lifting a ban on travel from Europe, raising hopes for a reopening of the almost $40 billion North Atlantic air corridor 16 months after flights were grounded by Covid-19. Shares of Air France-KLM, Deutsche Lufthansa AG and IAG SA gained in Europe after Biden said his Covid-19 advisers are weighing when to lift the prohibitions, while U.S. airline stocks also rose in pre-market trading. German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the issue in a White House meeting on Thursday. “It’s in process now,” Biden said at a news conference with Merkel following their meeting. Justin Trudeau laid out a timeline for reopening Canada’s border to U.S. and overseas travelers after months of resisting calls for a clear plan from business groups and his political rivals. The country will be able to welcome fully-vaccinated travelers from the U.S. as early as mid-August, and from all other countries by September, if “the current positive path of vaccination rate and public health conditions continue,” the prime minister’s office said Thursday night in a summary of his meeting with provincial leaders. About 25 million vaccine doses donated by the U.S. are set to be delivered to dozens of African nations in the coming weeks as the continent copes with a severe wave of infections. The first shipments -- almost 1 million doses of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine -- will be sent to Burkina Faso, Djibouti and Ethiopia within days, health officials said in a joint statement Friday. Singapore will temporarily close hundreds of nightlife venues and re-enforce stricter measures for dining-in just days after relaxing them, amid a surge in daily cases linked to a karaoke cluster, ministers said at a briefing Friday. The country will impose different restrictions on the local population based on their vaccination status, according to details released at a multi-ministry task force briefing on Friday, while warning that further restrictions may be necessary if daily cases continue to surge. The U.K. held out the prospect of restoring some restrictions amid a surge in new cases, just three days before it plans to drop all remaining social distancing rules. “Of course if we get into a situation where it’s unacceptable and we do need to put back further restrictions, then that of course is something the government will look at,” Lucy Frazer, a government minister, told Sky News on Friday. The U.K. held out the prospect of restoring some restrictions amid a surge in new cases, just three days before it plans to drop all remaining social distancing rules. Florida cases almost doubled in the week ending July 15, with 45,604 new cases compared to 23,697 in the previous week, state data show. The state’s positivity rate, meanwhile, surged from 7.8% to 11.5%. A total of 59 new new deaths were reported compared to 32 in the previous week. The CDC reported that Florida’s current 7-day average of new hospitalizations of confirmed Covid-19 patients rose to 553 from 359 in the previous week. Florida’s vaccination rate is about equal to the national average, with 55.2% of the population receiving at least one dose, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.  Las Vegas casino patrons are again being asked to wear masks. The Southern Nevada Health District on Friday recommended masks be worn in indoor public spaces regardless of vaccination status as new infections driven by the delta variant have soared.  The recommendation, which also applies to grocery stores, malls and large events  is a step to fully utilize the tools we have available to stop the pandemic,” the health district said in a press release.  Nevada is one of four states, with Missouri, Florida and Arkansas, classified by the CDC as a “high transmission” area.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-12/sas-loses-ceo-at-critical-time-as-airlines-continue-to-suffer,2021-01-12T06:25:53.895Z,SAS Chief Unexpectedly Bolts at ‘Critical’ Time for Airline,['Hanna Hoikkala'],Business,"SAS AB is unexpectedly losing its chief executive officer, leaving Scandinavia’s main airline to search for a replacement with the industry going through an unprecedented crisis. CEO Rickard Gustafson is leaving to take the top job at Swedish industrial giant SKF AB, according to a statement late Monday. The 56-year-old, who has spent a decade at the helm of Stockholm-based SAS, plans to leave by July 1 at the latest. The airline’s board now must find an experienced executive willing to take on the task of steering SAS through the coronavirus pandemic. The health crisis has delivered a body blow to air travel, with rising cases triggering new entry restrictions even as countries race to distribute vaccines. “Gustafson’s departure leaves SAS in a vacuum at a critical moment,” analysts at Sydbank wrote in a research note. “The task of reviving SAS is enormous.” For SKF, the maker of ball bearings and seals, Gustafson is likely to further accelerate a transition toward a more customer-focused, innovative and sustainable business, analysts at Citigroup said in a research note. He will need to accelerate acquisitions and organic growth in order for investors to re-rate the company, they said. SAS shares were up 0.4% at 9:50 a.m. in Stockholm. They dropped 56% in 2020. SKF gained 2.2%, after adding 13% last year. SAS was formed in 1946 by merging the main airlines of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The Danish and Swedish governments remain its largest shareholders with a combined 44% stake, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. Sweden’s Wallenberg family is the biggest private owner. Like other European airlines, SAS has been forced to ground planes, cut costs and lean on government support to remain solvent during the coronavirus crisis. In December, the company reported a loss of 9.3 billion kronor ($1.12 billion) for the year that ended in October, and said that it couldn’t provide an outlook for the current fiscal year. In particular, travel restrictions have forced Scandinavian carriers to cut back on trips to sunny spots and retreat to mostly regional routes. The most recent wave of virus cases has brought new curbs across the continent. The company is “crying out for continuity and someone who has a deep knowledge of both the airline industry and SAS’s complexity,” the Sydbank analysts said. Still, the carrier has had access to government support, most recently receiving a 1.5 billion kroner ($180 million) loan backed by the Norwegian government. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, by contrast, has been largely grounded for months. It sought insolvency protection in Ireland and is working on a court-supervised restructuring after Norway refused additional backing. As of late 2020, Gustafson had plans to remain in aviation for at least several years. On Nov. 25, he was named chairman-to-be of the International Aviation Transport Association, the industry’s main global lobby. The rotating one-year term was set to begin during 2022. SAS Chairman Carsten Dilling said that while he is “disappointed and sorry” that Gustafson is leaving, the company is in a stable, though critical position. “The board has of course immediately started the process to appoint a new president and CEO,” he said in the statement."

Friday’s total is part of a trend toward improving numbers since February, when vaccinations against the virus began to have an appreciable effect and cases started plummeting. The pent-up demand has pushed up airfares for the peak summer travel season as flight schedules have yet to be adjusted for Americans’ return to the skies. TSA officials screened 2,028,961 people at airport security checkpoints on Friday, 1.5 million more than on the same day a year ago and 74% of the number from 2019, two years ago, the agency said in a statement. A mask mandate remains in effect for airline travel through Sept. 13. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday, though, that fully vaccinated people do not have to wear a mask in outdoor settings at airports and other transportation settings like the top deck of a ferry. The seven-day average of people flying on U.S. airlines was 1.82 million -- also a post-pandemic high -- and is nearly three times what it was early in the year, according to TSA data. Even so, the weekly average is far below comparable periods from 2019. The past seven days were 71.2% below two years ago and that hasn’t changed appreciably since late May. June traditionally marks an upswing in airline travel as the school year ends and the summer holiday season starts. TSA screened an average of 2 million to 2.5 million travelers per day before Covid-19 hit. Screening volume at U.S. airports reached a low on 87,354 on April 13, 2020."

Sales over the past three weeks have been the best since the coronavirus pandemic began, American Airlines Group Inc. said, while United Airlines Holdings Inc. said high demand for spring and summer travel resulted in positive core cash flow this month. JetBlue Airways Corp. and Southwest Airlines Co. said they see first-quarter revenue declining less than they originally expected. “We’ve seen some glimmers of hope over the course of the last year, but this seems like it’s real,” Delta Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian Monday at a JPMorgan Chase & Co. conference. “It seems substantive. Although we have a long ways to go yet, we are in a much better place than we have been in a good period of time.” The projections appeared to be early signs of the surge in demand that carriers had been forecasting as Covid-19 case growth slowed and more U.S. residents get vaccinated. Demand continues to focus on beach and mountain destinations where travelers have sought to escape pressures of the pandemic. United advanced 8.2% to $60.91 at 1:25 p.m. in New York, leading a Standard & Poor’s index of nine U.S. carriers. American, up 7% to $25, and JetBlue, rising 5.6% to $21.59, rounded out the top three. Other airlines posted solid gains despite a weak broader market. The broad Standard & Poor’s airline index had advanced 32% this year through March 12. U.S. airlines carried more passengers on Friday and Sunday than at any point since March 16, 2020, when the pandemic erupted and caused a steep decline in air travel. Both days exceeded 1.3 million passengers, according to the Transportation Security Administration. American’s March bookings are “coming close” to where they were at the same point in 2019, Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker said at the conference, although they’re not producing a comparable amount of revenue because ticket prices have been discounted. American and United are raising fares for summer travel, however, as planes fill up. “The crisis isn’t over, but we certainly are seeing what looks like the beginning of a very large uptick,” he said. Consumers are likely to fly more frequently as the pandemic wanes because many people “already bought a new washing machine” or made other purchases and now feel free to spend discretionary funds on travel, United Chief Executive Officer Scott Kirby said. The carrier expects that business travel will begin “in earnest” next year and return to 2019 levels in 2023, he said. Delta projects corporate demand “slowly but steadily building back” as workers begin returning to offices later this year, said President Glen Hauenstein. Consumers are purchasing tickets for spring break until autumn, the carrier said in regulatory filing. That marks a hopeful change from earlier in the pandemic, when they booked travel only shortly in advance because of the uncertain outlook. While daily cash sales have improved 30% this month from February, Delta said it expects that first-quarter revenue will be at the low end of its previous outlook of down 60% to 65% from 2019. JetBlue said in a regulatory filing that first-quarter revenue would decline as much as 64% from the same period in 2019. The carrier previously forecast that the figure could be down as much as 70% from two years ago. Though “trends remain choppy,” bookings have improved for vacation travelers and people visiting friends and family, the New York-based carrier said. Southwest also said demand and fares are rising. The Dallas-based airline projected that revenue would fall as much as 60% in March, compared with an earlier outlook for a decline that could reach 65%. “With vaccine numbers going up and case numbers going down, there’s a light at the end of this very long tunnel,” CEO Gary Kelly said in his weekly message to employees."

EasyJet Plc said Wednesday that while it will operate no more than 20% of 2019 capacity in the current quarter, it’s ready to ramp up flights from May given enough demand. British Airways said U.K. plans to resume travel are headed in the right direction and that Europe should follow suit in coming months. There’s flexibility to rapidly boost operations and add destinations, EasyJet Chief Executive Officer Johan Lundgren said on a call, while cautioning that visibility over bookings is limited. The discounter lost as much as 730 million pounds ($1 billion) in the first half through March, according to a statement. The airlines are talking up a travel rebound even as the likelihood of an imminent reopening remains uncertain. The U.K., their biggest market, has held back on confirming that citizens will be able to resume leisure travel from May 17, while the EU’s sluggish jabs program suffered a further blow when Johnson & Johnson delayed a vaccine rollout amid concern about side effects. British Airways CEO Sean Doyle predicted a revival in EU states as immunizations gain traction, citing progress in Germany, and said he’s also hopeful highly profitable trans-Atlantic flights will reopen soon. Shares of EasyJet traded up 4.9% at 969.60 pence as of 3:32 p.m. in London, extending gains so far in 2021 to 17%. BA owner IAG SA was priced 3% higher and is up 31% for the year. Many commentators are less optimistic than the CEOs about a summer revival. Eamonn Brennan, director general of airspace manager Eurocontrol, said there’s no evidence as yet of a vaccine bounce, with flights down 64% this week compared with 2019, though things could improve from late May. John Grant, chief analyst at data specialist OAG, said airlines are on “shifting sands,” being forced to scrap 20% of flights at seven day’s notice and pushing back capacity increases planned for the next few weeks to August and beyond. Capacity is now likely to reach only 80 million scheduled seats a week by late September even in a best-case scenario, 20 million below estimates, he said. Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said EasyJet’s update indicated that fares also weakened last quarter, a worrying trend were it to continue into the summer. What happens next in Europe remains an unanswered question despite recent government moves. Lundgren said Mediterranean sunspots are keen to admit vaccinated Britons but that customers are being put off because the U.K. hasn’t said which countries it will reopen to first, with a requirement for everyone to undergo pricey Covid tests also acting as a brake. BA’s Doyle said the plans need to be both simpler and more ambitious. Robert Courts, the U.K. aviation minister, reiterated in testimony to the House of Commons transport committee that so-called Green List countries will be identified in early May based on data at the time. He advised people not to book holidays until the full roster is known. Global Air Travel Stuck Way Short of 2019 Levels: Flight Tracker Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, which just emerged from insolvency proceedings, on Wednesday increased its fundraising goals to provide a stronger cash buffer amid uncertainty about the relaxing of travel rules. While prospects for European travel remain clouded, there’s growing optimism that long-haul demand initially expected to remain in the doldrums for years may return faster than expected on some routes. Doyle said high vaccinations rates in the U.K. and U.S. mean the countries have an opportunity to create a bilateral framework for flights that could be copied by elsewhere. And London Heathrow airport CEO John Holland-Kaye said on a Eurocontrol webinar that he sees a restoration of links to the U.S., Caribbean and Singapore as more likely in the next few months than services to Europe."

New variants of the coronavirus and an uneven pace of vaccination could undermine a brightening outlook for the world economy, according to a communique agreed to on Saturday by Group of 20 finance ministers. U.S. cases remain elevated, after the delta variant was declared the nation’s dominant strain, spreading particularly in areas with low vaccination rates. New cases in Los Angeles County doubled this week. U.K. hospital cases increased by more than 56% in a week. Russia reported record deaths, while cases climbed in Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul and Tanzania. Singapore and the Netherlands reimposed curbs. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said in a tweet on Saturday that 70% of the country’s adult population has now been given at least one dose of a vaccine, earlier than planned. The government accelerated its vaccination campaign after the country started reporting a new increase in cases during June in some regions including Lisbon, with a high incidence of the delta variant. U.S. vaccinations have plunged to levels before Joe Biden was sworn in as president, despite the spread of the delta variant that is fueling a new rise in infections. The U.S. recorded 599,000 vaccinations on Saturday, the lowest level since early January, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. Daily vaccinations peaked in mid-April at almost 4 million. Biden missed his goal of administering at least one does of vaccine to 70% of adults in the U.S. by July 4. That number is now 67.5%, according to the CDC. The administration is focusing on communities hardest-hit by the delta variant, also largely the pockets in the U.S. that are least vaccinated. It has begun deploying health officials to support local “trusted messengers” to go door-to-door to encourage vaccines. Global finance chiefs signaled alarm over threats that could derail a fragile recovery as they concluded a meeting that sought to start reshaping the post-pandemic economic order. New variants of the coronavirus and an uneven pace of vaccination could undermine a brightening outlook for the world economy, according to a communique agreed to on Saturday by Group of 20 finance ministers at a gathering hosted by Italy in Venice. They resolved to keep up support for growth to ensure recoveries can continue to take hold. A Catholic priest in Wisconsin who violated Covid-19 restrictions and urged parishioners not to be a “guinea pig” by taking a vaccine was removed from his parish, according to a statement by the Diocese of La Crosse. In May, Bishop William Patrick Callahan had requested the resignation of Father James Altman, who had also said that Catholics couldn’t Democrats. The letter on Friday said that Callahan and the diocese “have spent over a year, prayerfully and fraternally, working toward a resolution” relating to Altman’s statements and activities -- and were now immediately removing him. In April, a church bulletin from Altman’s parish declared that a Covid vaccine was an “experimental use of a genetic altering substance that modifies your body -- your Temple of the Holy Spirit” and questioned whether the inoculations worked. Tanzania said it now has 408 new cases of Covid-19, as the East African nation takes another step in confronting the issue after months of denying the pandemic was a problem. Health Minister Dorothy Gwajima said at an event to promote the public wearing of masks in the capital Dodoma that “284 of the patients were hospitalized on oxygen therapy as of July 8.” The latest data represents a 300% increase from a figure of around 100 new cases announced by President Samia Suluhu Hassan on June 28. Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said that incentives to encourage inoculations in a state with one of the U.S.’s lowest vaccination rates had only “limited” success. He said “education” about the vaccines and their effectiveness against the delta variant is “the most powerful tool.” “The fishing licenses and lottery tickets we offered were worth a try, but we learned that the incentive wasn’t effective in changing the mind of someone who isn’t already inclined to get a vaccination,” the Republican governor said in his weekly radio address Friday evening. “The most powerful incentive is the reality that if Arkansas doesn’t significantly increase its rate of vaccinations, we won’t be getting rid of Covid-19 and its spinoffs anytime soon.” Arkansas and Nevada are the only states categorized as “high transmission” areas in the latest report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ” U.K. hospital cases increased by more than 56% in a week, the latest figures show. Some 3,081 people were admitted as of July 6, only two days after the country passed 2,000 for the first time since April. Another 32,367 cases and 34 deaths were also reported on Saturday. New cases in Los Angeles County doubled to 1,107 this week as health officials repeated their warning on the highly contagious delta variant. Friday’s positive test rate also climbed to 2.4%, up from 1.5% last week, the county said. About 40% of the county’s 10 million residents are still unvaccinated. To push for more inoculations, it’s offering lucky draws for concert tickets to artists including Celine Dion, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at the downtown Staples Center. “This delta variant of the Covid-19 virus spreads more easily than others,” said Barbara Ferrer, director of public health. “With vaccinations and good prevention measures, almost all of this transmission can be prevented.” U.S. cases remain elevated, as the delta variant was declared the nation’s dominant strain and is spreading largely in areas with low vaccination rates. Weekly cases were above 100,000 for the second consecutive week, the most since early June. Slightly more than 23,000 new cases were reported on Friday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg. Almost 350 new fatalities were reported Friday, as the overall death rate continued to decline. Officials have discovered a worker infected with a mutated strain of Covid-19 at the Hong Kong International Airport. The airport and other places where the man visited will undergo compulsory testing. The L452R variant that the porter carried makes the virus more transmissible, the government said in a statement. About 4,300 Iranians have traveled to the country’s border with Armenia since June 22 to receive vaccines, the Tasnim news agency reported, citing Rouhollah Latifi, the spokesman for the Iran Customs Administration. With a population of more than 80 million, Iran has so far vaccinated around 4.6 million people, with only 2.1 million having received two doses, health ministry data showed. Malta will require travelers over the age of 13 who want to enter the country to prove they’ve been fully vaccinated, the Associated Press reported. The country is working to stop a rise in infections linked to travel. Visitors can enter by showing a certificate issued by Malta, the EU or the U.K., it said. “Malta will be the first EU country taking this step,” Health Minister Chris Fearne said. The U.K. will introduce vaccine passports later this year for entry into bars, restaurants and nightclubs to help tackle a slowdown in people getting the inoculation, the Times reported. The certificates will prove customers are either fully immunized or have received a negative test result the previous day. Earlier, the country said daily cases surged again, presenting Prime Minister Boris Johnson with more worrying data about the fast-spreading delta variant of the virus ahead of a planned easing of restrictions on July 19. Oxford, home of the AstraZeneca shot, advised residents not to travel after cases in the city spiked, the Oxford Mail reported. The reproduction rate of the virus in England has risen to levels last seen in October, the government said Friday. Cases of the delta variant, which now accounts for 99% of U.K. infections, rose by almost a third in the past week to 216,249 cases, data from Public Health England showed. Lagging indicators like hospitalizations and deaths haven’t risen as much. Enough Covid-19 vaccines have been delivered to EU member states to be able to fully vaccinate at least 70% of adults there in July, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Saturday. About 500 million vaccine doses will have been distributed across the bloc by Sunday, she added. Just over 53% of the population have received at least one dose and almost 39% are fully vaccinated, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. Russia on Saturday reported a record 752 Covid-19 deaths. Russia’s health crisis has worsened since May, with a surge of infections fueled by the delta variant forcing many regions to impose mandatory vaccination requirements to pressure people into getting shots. Russia reported a 6-month high of 25,766 new cases on Friday, according to the state-run monitoring center. The number of daily infections doubled over the course of June.

The airline agreed to buy 200 Boeing Co. 737 Max jets and 70 Airbus SE A321neo planes, a deal valued at about $15 billion based on estimates by aircraft appraiser Ascend by Cirium. Those planes and other United single-aisle jets will get a revamped cabin with seat-back screens and larger overhead bins, according to a company statement Tuesday. United’s refreshed cabin with screens at each seat. Source: United The plans signal the airline’s intention to step up competition with Delta Air Lines Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. for premium-seat customers, who demand more creature comforts and typically generate an outsize portion of industry profits. United will also use the new planes to reduce its use of smaller regional jets amid an anticipated rebound in corporate demand, which is still stuck at less than half the pre-pandemic level. “We’re deadly serious at United Airlines about getting people to fly United,” Chief Executive Officer Scott Kirby said in a webcast presentation. “The bet we’re making today is not about business travel returning -- business travel is going to return. The bet we’re making today is that customers care about the product.” Kirby declined to specify the purchasing discounts that United, one of the world’s largest airlines, obtained from the jet manufacturers. The order includes 50 of Boeing’s best-selling plane, the Max 8, along with 150 of the larger Max 10 jets. The purchase boosts United’s Max order book to 380, excluding 30 aircraft that have been delivered, according to the U.S. planemaker. Boeing’s workhorse jet is in the midst of a comeback from a 20-month grounding that was prompted by two deadly crashes. United previously ordered 50 of Airbus’s longer-range A321XLR aircraft for flights from the U.S. to Europe. A significant portion of the newly ordered jets will be built at Airbus’s Mobile, Alabama, facility, the European planemaker said. Boeing fell 1.8% to $235.76 at the close in New York. United slipped less than 1% to $52.15, while Airbus posted a similar decline to close at 106.48 euros in Paris. Combined with United’s existing orders from Airbus and Boeing, the purchases will enable the airline to introduce more than 500 new single-aisle jets over the next five years, Kirby said. That includes 40 next year, 138 in 2023 and as many as 350 aircraft in 2024 and beyond. By 2026, the larger-plane strategy will boost United’s seats for each departure by 30% compared with 2019 levels. The gain will be about 75% for premium berths per North American departure. The increased seat count in United’s new fleet will lead to an 8% drop in costs for each seat flown a mile, Kirby said. The roomy Max 10 and A321neo planes are designed to help United grow at its hubs in Newark, New Jersey, and San Francisco, said Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella. Those airports, located in highly lucrative corporate-travel markets, are constrained in adding more flights due to limits on aircraft movements in a given time period -- another reason to use bigger planes. “We’re going to compete against all product types out there,” Nocella said. United plans to cull more than 200 of its 50-seat regional jets, restricting those planes to flights serving the smallest communities, mostly from its Denver hub, Nocella said. The company also plans to retire its Boeing 757-200 fleet while keeping its 21 larger 757-300 aircraft. “Boeing’s need for a 757 replacement was highlighted, as United appeared to prefer the Airbus A321 for that mission,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson said in a report. United will also get rid of some of its oldest Airbus A319 and A320 jets, Nocella said. All told, the Chicago-based airline will retire about 300 planes. The move toward larger domestic aircraft and a refreshed cabin mimics a strategy set several years ago by Delta, which minimized its reliance on regional jets and shifted many routes to bigger planes with more premium seats. United’s decision to put screens at each seat also echoes Delta’s approach, while American contends that most passengers prefer to stream entertainment on their own devices. The new interior will be applied to two thirds of older aircraft by 2023 and virtually all by mid-2025, United said. The company said it would include a power outlet at each seat and larger bins for every customer to have a roller bag, helping them to avoid gate checking of luggage. The carrier also will upgrade the Wi-Fi access to broadband speeds on its fleet."

Carriers will lose about $48 billion in 2021, the International Air Transport Association said in April, after earlier forecasting a $38 billion deficit. Yet Airbus maintained a brisk pace of jet deliveries in May, and its tally for the first five months of the year is well ahead of the same tally for 2020. That’s an indication of why the Toulouse, France-based company is optimistic about an eventual recovery in demand. “One thing is clear to me is that people want to fly again. Hardly more, but probably also no less than before the pandemic,” Faury said. Above all, he said, people want to “fly better” and in future passengers will not book economy but opt for premium economy or even business class."

Citing concern about the spread of the beta variant of the virus, U.K. ordered late Friday that anyone arriving after Monday from across the Channel will have to isolate at home for up to 10 days and will need at least two coronavirus tests after arrival even if they are vaccinated. The new system, dubbed “Amber Plus” to draw a distinction from the government’s Amber list of restricted countries, will apply to all English travelers currently in France and also to travelers further afield who need to drive through France to return to the U.K. Spain and Italy -- both major destinations for Britons -- remain on the Amber list, which from Monday will no longer require the additional tests and quarantine. The move adds a further level of complexity and expense for English families trying to plot their way through the summer after the end of a torrid school year. Taking the two tests, and the option of a third to break isolation early, will add hundreds of pounds to the cost of a trip to France. “This announcement will undoubtedly dent consumer confidence in overseas travel just as we are about to see many amber-listed countries opening up,” travel agents’ and tour operators’ association ABTA said in a statement. “Continuing changes to travel restrictions will delay any meaningful recovery for the industry.” The move comes days before Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to lift most remaining Covid restrictions on Monday, even as new cases in the U.K. approach record levels. The decision also delivered another setback to a tourism industry that was beginning to look to the future with guarded optimism. “This decision adds yet more confusion to a travel system already complex enough,” said Tim Alderslade, chief executive officer of Airlines UK. “These random rule changes make it almost impossible for travelers and industry to plan ahead, and can only further undermine consumer trust at the very peak of the summer season.” The government cited what it called the “persistent presence” in France of cases of the beta variant first identified in South Africa for its decision. The variant is not only highly infectious but more resistant to vaccines than other strains. In France the majority of cases of the strain have been recorded on La Reunion, a French island off the coast of southern Africa and not in mainland France. “With restrictions lifting on Monday across the country, we will do everything we can to ensure international travel is conducted as safely as possible, and protect our borders from the threat of variants,” Health Secretary Sajid Javid said. Javid, who has been in the post for less than a month, announced on Saturday that he had tested positive for Covid-19, even after receiving both doses of the vaccine. The travel announcement came Friday hours after official figures showed the U.K. had more than 50,000 new infections for the first time in six months, the bulk of them being the delta variant. France reported more than 10,000 new cases Friday, with more than 60% of them delta. “The U.K. has no coherent policy on international travel,” said Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association. “The U.K. is entrenching itself as outlier in its confused approach to travel. This, in turn, is destroying its own travel sector and the thousands of jobs that rely on it.”"

Amathus, Cyprus (AP) -- It’s said that Demetrius the Besieger, a mighty warrior king and one of Alexander the Great’s successors, built this harbor on Cyprus’ southern coast 2,400 years ago to thwart a potential naval invasion from the ruler of Egypt, Ptolemy I, another of Alexander’s heirs. French archaeologists who initially studied the ancient harbor of Amathus believe it to be an incomplete military fortification work, the three piers of which would have accommodated the best of the ancient world’s naval ships, ready to repel an attacking force. Lying just a few feet underwater a mere 200 feet off the coastline near the resort town of Limassol, the harbor will soon be Cyprus’ newest tourist attraction where adventurous holidaymakers can snorkel over its submerged stone remains. It’s a novel direction for Cyprus’ tourism authorities, who are looking beyond the east Mediterranean island nation's long-held “sun and surf” product to reach out to specialized tourism markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has slashed tourism arrivals for an island that relies much on that revenue, so Cyprus authorities are taking a fresh look at what the island has to offer visitors, to re-ignite interest among those who do opt to travel. Cyprus Antiquities department official Yiannis Violaris says what makes the harbor unique to the entire eastern Mediterranean is its state of preservation, combined with its proximity to the coastline. He says those attributes could bring more people amid a global surge of interest in diving tourism. The fact that Cyprus has earned top marks for the cleanest waters among all other European Union nations for the second year running is also a big bonus. “Tourists as well as local visitors will have the opportunity to see this impressive ancient harbor, to swim over it and to see how it was constructed, with three moles enclosing it,” Violaris told the Associated Press. Specialist diving crews are currently cleaning the harbor of vegetation and will mark underwater routes that swimmers can follow on their tour. Diving tourism isn't entirely new for the island. Divers have for years been flocking to the wreck of the MS Zenobia, a Swedish-built ferry that sank in about 140 feet of water just over a mile off the coastal town of Larnaca in 1980. The wreck has been ranked as one of the world's best for divers. But diving shop owner Michalis Sinopouris says authorities need to do a lot more to put Cyprus solidly on the global diving map like scuttling larger ships near the coasts to create artificial reefs. Tourism directly accounts for around 13% of Cyprus’ economy. According to the latest available figures, tourist arrivals between January and February this year marked an 86% drop from the same period in 2019 when Cyprus hit an all-time high in the number of travelers who opted to holiday on the island. Tourism officials had hoped for the industry to rebound this month once the U.K. and Russia — Cyprus’ top two markets — had put the island on their “green” list of safe destinations. Now they’re hoping that August may be the turnaround month. Industry bosses recognize that the sector is hardly “out of the woods” and are urging a re-think on how to market Cyprus’ tourism product. Hotels Association Chief Haris Loizides told an industry conference last week that the country’s tourism “needs to adapt dramatically to survive and continue its critical contribution” to the economy. He proposed a greater focus on the “big picture” of what Cyprus has to offer, like local culture and cuisine, while reaching out to niche markets through digital marketing. “The sustainability of the mass market is being questioned,” Loizides said. “I dare say massive gatherings will gradually become things of the past.” It’s a message that Cyprus’ Deputy Ministry for Tourism has taken to heart, redesigning its logo and reaching out to new markets. “I don’t lose my courage and my optimism because the EU is a big market, so many, many countries, and they feel that the psychology for travel is only now starting to pick up in Europe,” Tourism Deputy Minister Savvas Perdios told The Associated Press. Perdios said authorities are working to extend the holiday season with the launch of a “game changing” campaign dubbed “Heartland of Legends” where tourists can visit a village and witness locals making the island’s world-famous Halloumi cheese, among other experiences. Perdios said despite the drop in arrivals from the U.K. and Russia, he’s encouraged by the digital interest that potential holidaymakers from nontraditional markets such as France and Germany are showing in traveling to Cyprus. “We have been working on these markets. ... Things won’t happen from just one day to the next, so I’m still optimistic,” said Perdios. Perhaps Demetrius the Besieger would have approved."

Positive Rate Rises; Vaccine Holdouts Polled: Virus Update,[],Business,"President Joe Biden shops at a market after touring a fruit farm in Central Lake, Michigan on July 3. New York’s statewide positive-test rate increased for the fifth day in a row, while a poll suggested that the share of people in the U.S. who are unlikely to get vaccinated is bigger than in April. More than a quarter of people in the U.S. say they’re unlikely to get a Covid-19 shot, with 20% saying they definitely won’t and 9% saying they probably won’t, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll. That compares with a combined 24% in April in a poll by the same outlets. The data illustrate the challenge for the Biden administration and state and local officials in expanding vaccination beyond the 67% who have received at least one dose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the poll, 35% said U.S. officials are exaggerating the threat of the delta variant of the virus, with more Republicans than Democrats holding that view. The survey found that 86% of Democrats have received at least one shot, compared with 45% of Republicans. The June 27-30 poll of 907 adults has an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Routine testing and voluntary mask-wearing are among workplace changes likely to be part of a “new normal” as businesses look to minimize the spread of illnesses, former Food and Drug Administration head Scott Gottlieb said. “Going to work with the sniffles is going to be frowned upon,” he said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “I think businesses are going to have access to routine testing.” Voluntary mask usage, especially among people who are at higher risk from respiratory diseases, is going to become more normalized, as will symptom checks and the use of fever guns, despite the latter not being “that helpful,” he said. “I don’t think we could be complacent about the risk of respiratory pathogens in the workplace, in schools anymore, so people are going to need to be more vigilant,” Gottlieb said. Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel was hospitalized on Sunday, a week after testing positive for Covid-19. He had tested positive days after attending a June 24-25 summit meeting with fellow European Union leaders in Brussels. Bettel, 48, will remain in the hospital as a precaution for 24 hours for tests and observation, the Luxembourg government said in a statement on its website. He received his first vaccine dose on May 6, the premier announced in a tweet at the time. Local media reported that he received the AstraZeneca shot. Israel Prime Minister Naftali Bennett held talks with Pfizer Inc. over the possibility of swapping the country’s expiring doses of Covid-19 vaccine with other countries, Haaretz reported, citing a statement from the prime minister’s office. In calls with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, Bennett also discussed options for future vaccine shipments, Haaretz said. Israel is negotiating with at least two countries to offload expiring vaccines after a deal with the Palestinian Authority fell through. The spread in Europe of the delta variant is dashing hopes of recovery in air travel, with the head of a major airports operator warning that it could cut short any rebound. “The delta variant is creating such uncertainty that we can’t be sure what’s going to happen in three weeks,” said Augustin de Romanet, chief executive officer of ADP, which also manages dozens of other hubs worldwide. “It’s making us very, very cautious, especially for September and October when the pandemic could come back strongly once again,” he said in an interview on the sidelines of an annual economic conference in Aix-en-Provence this weekend. Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson said his state is working with employers as a strategy to overcome vaccine hesitancy. “The employers have an opportunity to make it accessible” for employees and give them paid time off, he said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. They can also “encourage them with the right level of education and information.” Hutchinson said young adults in the state are now getting hit with the delta variant, causing an increase in hospitalizations. In Arkansas, about 42% of population have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, lower than the nationwide total, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker. Indonesia tightened entry requirements for travelers and ordered a ramp-up in oxygen production, as the nation saw its worst day for Covid-19 deaths. Starting July 6, foreign visitors arriving in the country will be required to show proof of vaccination and a negative PCR test result. All incoming travelers must complete eight days of quarantine, instead of five, and be tested twice for the virus. The government also told oxygen producers to shift all output to medical use. The change should yield 1,700 tons of oxygen per day nationwide, of which 1,400 tons will be for use on the main island of Java, according to Luhut Binsar Panjaitan, who’s been appointed to lead Indonesia’s pandemic response. The country is making “a full industrial oxygen conversion to pharmaceutical oxygen. Our shortfall can be fulfilled later,” Panjaitan said in a statement. Indonesia reported 27,233 new Covid-19 cases and a record 555 fatalities on Sunday. Some people who received the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 shot in the U.S. are seeking out added doses of a messenger-RNA vaccine, fearing their initial inoculation won’t protect them from the virus. Demand for the one-and-done J&J shot has suffered in part due to the perception that it’s inferior to the two-dose mRNA vaccines that showed higher efficacy in clinical trials. But it is unclear if mixing vaccines will safely increase protection, and there are fresh signs that J&J’s shot is a strong shield against variants. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people don’t mix vaccines until robust clinical data validates the benefit and quells concerns about risks. Trends in the fight against Covid-19 are “very positive,” even with cases high, putting England on course for a “more permissive phase” as the mandatory face mask rule is dropped this month, according to U.K. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick. The government hopes to remove remaining legal restrictions on July 19, and measures in place to tackle the virus are set to become “matters of personal choice,” Jenrick said Sunday on Sky News. Separately, the Sunday Telegraph reported that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has approved a series of measures on how the country will live with coronavirus. Part of the plan will involve scrapping rules for social distancing in pubs and restaurants, and dropping the legal requirement for customers to sign in to venues using QR codes or sharing contact details.  A former Food and Administration head said he expects the pandemic experience to change some workplace practices. Luxembourg’s prime minister, who tested positive for Covid-19 after attending a summit with other European Union leaders, was hospitalized for observation. England’s rules to tackle the virus, including a mandatory face mask requirement, will become “matters of personal choice” when restrictions are lifted this month, U.K. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said.   Key Developments: A wave of infections may hit France by the end of July because of the delta variant, based on what’s happening in the U.K., French Health Minister Olivier Veran said on Twitter.  He said cases in France have rebounded in the past five days and urged residents to get vaccinated to limit the wave.  New York’s statewide positive-test rate increased for the fifth consecutive day, according to official data. Governor Andrew Cuomo urged more residents to get vaccinated, saying “don’t delay.” The seven-day rolling average of positive tests rose to 0.54% on Saturday, Cuomo said in a statement. That compares with a peak of almost 8% in January, when daily new cases peaked at almost 20,000. The positive rate has increased steadily since June 29, according to data provided in daily updates by Cuomo. Covid-19 patients in intensive-care units across the state increased by six to 85, Cuomo said.

Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. reported a net loss of HK$21.65 billion ($2.8 billion) for 2020, a period the carrier described as “the most challenging 12 months of its more than 70-year history” as the coronavirus pandemic brought unprecedented disruption to global air travel. The outlook isn’t much better, according to Chairman Patrick Healy, who said “it is by no means clear how the pandemic and its impact will develop.” Hong Kong has largely closed its borders to non-residents and imposed 21-day mandatory hotel quarantine on those who return. Cathay expects to operate at well below 50% passenger capacity in 2021. The company said it will persist with cash preservation measures, which include maintaining executive pay cuts through this year. And it has asked employees to sign up for a third “special leave program” in the first half of 2021, to which 80% have agreed. Previous programs have involved staff taking three weeks of unpaid leave over a designated period. Cathay raised HK$39 billion in a recapitalization in July, and its available unrestricted liquidity stood at HK$28.6 billion at the end of 2020. It also issued HK$6.74 billion in convertible bonds this year to secure more funds. At a briefing Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Augustus Tang said the company’s cash and liquidity condition is healthy. Last year started fairly promisingly for Cathay with a slight pickup in traffic after a tough second half of 2019, when anti-government protests rocked Hong Kong and hit the Asian financial center’s visitor numbers. But the carrier’s position worsened drastically with the onset of Covid-19 in Wuhan in late January. At that point, on Jan. 22, Cathay issued a press release with the first sentence unusually all in bold: “Due to the evolving information from health authorities, we will allow crew members and front-line airport employees to wear surgical face masks when on duty at their discretion,” it said. Strange as it might seem now that masks are ubiquitous, the policy was well ahead of its time -- and an omen of the chaos about to hit global air travel. A day later, regional unit Cathay Dragon suspended flights to and from Wuhan for a month. On Jan. 26, the suspension was pushed to the end of March, and then matters snowballed as the pandemic took hold, ripping travel plans and the aviation industry apart. The extent of the damage from 2020 on Hong Kong’s flag carrier was revealed shortly after midday Wednesday. The airline had already warned the numbers wouldn’t be pretty following a first-half loss of HK$9.87 billion. For the July-December period the loss was even bigger, at HK$11.8 billion. “The pace of recovery remains highly uncertain,” Healy said at Wednesday’s online briefing, though the company does expect some improvement in the second half of 2021. The loss was net HK$2.7 billion of Covid-related government grants. It included impairment and related charges of HK$4.1 billion on 34 aircraft unlikely to reenter meaningful service again before being retired or returned to lessors, as well as subsidiaries’ assets and HK$4 billion of restructuring costs, including a HK$1.6 billion write-off of a deferred tax asset at Cathay Dragon. Even after the recapitalization in July and cost-reductions through layoffs, pay cuts and a skeleton flight schedule, Cathay is still burning through HK$1.5 billion or more a month, with passenger traffic down 99% from pre-pandemic levels. A recent law requiring flight crew to quarantine has added to Cathay’s woes -- and a further HK$300 million to HK$400 million to its monthly cash drain. There’s no indication how long the crew quarantine rule will stay in place, Healy said, adding he’s pleased with the sign-up rate for vaccinations among staff. Still, the rule has become a major short-term headwind for Cathay because it has forced it to scale back operations, including cargo services, which have been a source of strength and continue to look positive. Cathay said it reached an agreement with Airbus SE to defer delivery of A350-900s and A350-1000s to as far out as 2023 and its A321neos to as far out as 2025. The airline is also in advanced negotiations with Boeing Co. on the deferral of 777-9 deliveries. Chief Operations and Service Delivery Officer Greg Hughes said those Boeing aircraft aren’t expected to arrive before 2025. Cathay took delivery of 10 new aircraft in 2020, including its first A321neo, and partially converted four Boeing 777-300ER passenger aircraft to provide additional cargo-carrying capacity. The company is transferring certain aircraft from Cathay Dragon to Cathay and low-cost unit HK Express, which it has no plans to list, Tang said. Andrew Lee, an analyst at Jefferies, said he expects Cathay to remain loss-making until travel and quarantine restrictions ease and international travel returns, noting that 82 of the carrier’s planes are parked in locations outside Hong Kong. “However, we maintain a buy with our HK$8.00 price target as we estimate Cathy’s is close to the bottom given January passenger traffic was already down 99% year-on-year,” Lee wrote in a note. The downbeat 2020 results followed the pattern of monthly reports last year as the pandemic showed no signs of easing. “Our passenger business continues to face significant challenges,” Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said in a previous statement on Cathay’s December traffic figures. One optimistic note came in an October release amid plans to open a travel corridor with Singapore, which Lam described as “a hugely encouraging development.” That was soon snuffed out though as the plan was shelved due to a virus flareup in Hong Kong. Lam said Wednesday the Hong Kong and Singapore governments are still communicating about the travel bubble. Cathay’s shares slid as much as 2.3% when trading resumed Wednesday afternoon following the results, before paring the loss to 0.6% at the close. They’ve stabilized this year after slumping almost 30% in 2020. Jan. 28: Cathay Pacific and Cathay Dragon will be progressively reducing the capacity of our flights to and from mainland China by 50% or more from Jan. 30 to the end of March. Feb. 17: Our performance deteriorated rapidly in the last week of January as the coronavirus situation became more severe. We saw significant cancellation of bookings within a short period. March 16: The challenge we are currently facing is unprecedented. April 16: Passenger demand dropped rapidly and tremendously in late March following the introduction of arrival restrictions on all non-resident visitors to Hong Kong, including transit passengers. May 15: This is the biggest challenge to aviation we have ever witnessed. Aug. 14: In addition to the Covid-19 pandemic, we have to contend with a looming global recession and geopolitical tensions. Sept. 14: We are weathering the storm for now, but the fact remains that we simply will not survive unless we adapt our airlines for the new travel market. Oct. 19: We expect we will be operating approximately 10% of our pre-pandemic passenger flight capacity for the rest of 2020 and under 50% for overall 2021. Nov. 5: Executive pay cuts will continue throughout 2021 and a third voluntary special leave scheme for non-flying employees will be introduced. There will be no salary increases for 2021. Dec. 16: We are still not seeing any meaningful improvement in our passenger business. March 10: The correlation between the roll-out of vaccination programs in our key markets and the potential future relaxation of travel restrictions remains highly uncertain and difficult to predict."

The deal is slated to value the combined entity at about $2 billion, according to people with knowledge of the matter, although terms could change. Shares of Embraer surged 12% to 19.38 reais at 11:25 a.m. in Sao Paulo, and earlier climbed as high as 19.94 reais.

The move will affect more than 7,000 employees and take effect Aug. 1, the airline told employees Friday. Southwest declined to provide the total cost of the increases, which will go to baggage and cargo handlers, workers who clean aircraft or deliver parts, reservations agents, customer-service employees and others. The airline had 56,500 full-time employees at the end of 2020. Southwest is following companies in other industries such as McDonald’s Corp., Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. and Under Armour Inc. that have increased pay to attract workers even though employment remains below pre-pandemic levels. A recent jobs report showed a larger-than-forecast pickup in average hourly wages for a second straight month, indicating a shortage of people ready to work at existing pay rates. “It’s a prudent decision to make sure we don’t have labor shortages two and three years down the road as we try to execute the plan” for expansion, Russell McCrady, Southwest’s vice president of labor relations, said in an interview. Ongoing efforts at various levels of government to increase the minimum wage prompted early discussions of the change. Southwest is the most heavily unionized among large U.S. carriers, with more than 80% of its employees represented by labor groups. It’s rare for a company to unilaterally raise wages or change them outside of contract negotiations, although American Airlines Group Inc. did so in 2017, when it boosted pay for pilots and flight attendants to better match rivals’ and soothe strained labor relations. With the increase, Southwest is “acknowledging that the pay scales contained in our collective bargaining agreement are entirely too low in order to compete in today’s labor force,” Randy Barnes, president of Transport Workers Union Local 555, said in a video message to members. “I agree wholeheartedly.” The union is in negotiations for a new contract. Southwest was little changed at $54.68 at 3:36 p.m. in New York trading, the best performance on a Standard & Poor’s index of the five largest U.S. carriers. Since the pandemic began, Southwest has added, or announced plans to add, 18 new cities to its network. It’s also restoring service that was scaled back now that Americans are filling flights to take delayed vacations. Earlier this month, the airline accelerated plans to add Boeing Co.’s 737 Max 7 aircraft to its fleet, and will receive at least 94 of the planes in 2022 and 2023. Southwest wants to gain a bigger share of leisure passengers nationwide as demand rebounds and has a “huge opportunity” to secure more corporate travel accounts, Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly told CNBC on Thursday. The average wage increase at the Dallas-based carrier will be about $1.30 an hour. That equates to 7% to 11% more for new hires. For existing employees, it’s about a 3% to 10% hourly rate increase. Southwest can unilaterally adjust pay rates under the contracts of two unions that represent affected employees, and is negotiating the change with two others. The airline is sufficiently staffed for the summer, McCrady said. It has been calling back employees who took extended leaves during the pandemic."

(Source: Bloomberg) Bob Smith, CEO of Blue Origin, and Ariane Cornell, director of astronaut sales, talk about customer demand for flights. They spoke in Texas before Jeff Bezos and three others blasted off in the New Shepard rocket. (Source: Bloomberg) “Best day ever,” Bezos said on a livestream of the suborbital flight shortly before the capsule landed. The mission capped this month’s one-two punch demonstrating the potential for space-tourism ventures, even as critics questioned the value of the super-rich taking joy rides to the heavens. Nine days before Bezos’s trip, U.K. billionaire Richard Branson flew on a space plane made by Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc., and both companies have plans to entice customers to pay big money for a unique travel experience. “Impressive!” Branson said in a tweet after the Blue Origin trip. “Very best to all the crew from me and all the team at @virgingalactic.” Bezos and Branson are just two of the billionaires playing a key role in building a space industry and envisioning a future in which people regularly leave the planet. Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the company founded by their fellow space magnate Elon Musk, last year lifted astronauts from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration into orbit on missions to the International Space Station. After the Blue Origin trip, Bezos told Bloomberg TV that his journey was more than he’d dreamed of, adding that micro gravity felt “normal.” Blue Origin’s long-term vision is for orbital flight, Bezos said. “We are building a road to space so that future generations can build the future,” he said. “We live on this beautiful planet, it’s the most beautiful planet in the solar system by far and we have to protect it.” Critics on social media and even in the U.S. Congress took a more jaundiced view. Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, questioned the value of space flights catering to the ultra rich. “I don’t think I’ve heard of a bigger oxymoron than talking about billionaires going up into space and then using the word democratizing,” Khanna told MSNBC. “There’s a deeper problem, and that is that these tech leaders view the social good as equated to technological progress and market value. They’re missing key principles such as justice, such as liberty, such as equality, such as compassion.” Bezos seemed to anticipate some of the criticism. Following his space flight, he announced two $100 million civility and courage awards designed to further philanthropic endeavors. One went to Van Jones, a political analyst on CNN and former adviser in the Obama administration, who will distribute the money to charities. The other went to Jose Andres, a celebrity chef who has opened multiple community kitchens to help feed people amid natural disasters. Andres said he wants to “revolutionize disaster and hunger relief.” Before the Blue Origin flight, the company built suspense around the trip with a well-publicized auction. An anonymous bidder offered $28 million to fly alongside Bezos, but what Blue Origin described as a timing conflict left an opening for Daemen. The Dutch teenager was the youngest person to travel to space, while Funk was the oldest. “I’ve been waiting a long time to finally get up there,” Funk told reporters after the mission. “I want to go again fast.” The highly publicized excursions by space moguls are likely to serve as a vote of confidence in the safety of the rocket rides the companies want to sell to wealthy tourists. On July 11, Branson demonstrated Virgin Galactic’s capabilities by boarding the company’s space plane and flying to an altitude of 53.5 miles, where passengers also experienced weightlessness. Bezos, 57, said he’s planned on traveling to space since he was five years old. He started Amazon as an online book business from his Seattle garage in 1994 and turned it into the world’s largest online retailer, making him the wealthiest man on the planet with a net worth exceeding $200 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He’s been selling Amazon stock to fund Blue Origin, which is based in Kent, Washington, now has 3,500 employees and also builds rocket engines used to launch satellites. Bezos stepped down as Amazon CEO earlier this month to become executive chairman of the e-commerce giant. The ultimate goal is to make such trips routine on rockets that are reused like airplanes. The New Shepard booster returned to a landing pad so it can be reused rather than breaking apart in the atmosphere. Reusable rockets are key to lowering the cost of space travel, which could make it more accessible. Blue Origin hasn’t disclosed the expected price of future space trips or the amount paid by Daemen, the teenage passenger. “The architecture and technology we have chosen is complete overkill for a sub-orbital tourism mission,” Bezos said at a press conference following his return. “Why did we do that? Because it scales. It’s an architecture that can grow to very large size.”"

With air travel still showing no signs of recovery in the region, the carriers may have to contend with their saviors as powerful shareholders for some time to come. Air France-KLM on Tuesday became the latest to get a 4 billion-euro ($4.7 billion) bailout that will see the French government reemerge as its biggest shareholder with a stake of up to 30%. The flag bearer joins Germany’s Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Alitalia SpA, Sweden’s SAS AB and TAP Air Portugal to see a bigger state presence following aid sought to cope with one of the industry’s worst crises. Airlines have been among the hardest hit by Covid-19, which decimated air travel. Even before the latest setbacks, the International Air Transport Association said carriers would need as much as $80 billion more in government money this year. The concern in Europe now is that demands from the shareholding states may skew the industry in ways that would have an impact on everything from cost cuts to route decisions and ticket prices. “While bailing out airlines in the context of the Covid-19 crisis is certainly a legitimate emergency measure, the suspicion is that this might serve as an excuse to return to state-owned carriers serving political agendas, at least for some governments,” said Sascha Albers, a professor of international management at the University of Antwerp. Prior to Tuesday’s Air France-KLM announcement, European Union states had channeled at least 23 billion euros into airlines through loans, guarantees, capital injections and grants. Airlines the world over have received state aid. In June, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. sold preferred stock and warrants to the Hong Kong government convertible into a stake in the airline. Singapore Airlines Ltd. raised funds in a rights issue backed by state investor Temasek Holdings Pte. In the U.S., the government has made about $50 billion in aid available for carriers since the start of the pandemic in the form of grants and loans to cover employee costs. European governments are being left with significant stakes more than two decades after the region’s airlines began being privatized -- British Airways in 1987 followed by Lufthansa in 1997 and Air France in 1999. The 1990s also saw the EU’s deregulation of the airline industry, boosting low-cost carriers including EasyJet Plc and Ryanair Holdings Plc. Preparing for the post-pandemic era will require airlines to take a hard look at their cost structures and organization. In Europe, with strong unions at former state-owned carriers, political interference in commercial operations may be tempting for some governments, especially with issues like job cuts, analysts said. “Many governments still take the view that a national carrier is part of their overall political vision,” said John Strickland, who runs JLS Consulting in London. “It’s not surprising to see further government investment in Air France but the key question is whether it will lead to attempts to impose political direction on the group’s management beyond their commercial objectives.” In France, a country with a long history of state intervention in the corporate world and a longstanding stake in Air France-KLM, the government was quick to offer up guarantees that it would ensure the survival of the carrier. “Air France is a major and strategic company for France,” Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in a Bloomberg TV interview Wednesday. “I would not say that this is the last support that we are giving to Air France.” Even in the Netherlands, which was more circumspect -- slower to provide loans last year and not offering up additional aid Tuesday -- the government acknowledged the airline is too important to the country to fail. “The network of AF-KLM is important for our economy and both airlines indirectly facilitate lots of employment,” Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra wrote on Twitter Tuesday. “It is in the public interest of France and the Netherlands that airlines Air France and KLM get through this crisis.” Germany’s 20% stake in Lufthansa following its multi-billion euro bailout thrust the state back into the heart of a company that was privatized with fanfare two decades ago. Berlin also lent billions to Condor and TUI AG to keep them flying through the coronavirus storm. “For many airlines, the absence of government support could ultimately mean disaster, especially for the large carriers.” said Shukor Yusof, the founder of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. The European Commission has been under pressure to rubber-stamp aid and save the region’s economy. It’s complied, but attached strict conditions that make it less comfortable for the carriers -- forcing them to give up airport slots, restricting executive compensation and banning acquisitions in some cases. It’s also playing hardball on Italy’s plan to create a new, smaller carrier from the ashes of Alitalia. All that hasn’t stopped discount carriers such as Ryanair and Wizz Air Holdings Plc from crying foul. They argue that bailouts will distort the market and create an unfair advantage. Ryanair, which on Wednesday warned that it will struggle to return to profitability this year, has filed more than a dozen court appeals against EU approvals. It argues that such aid unfairly discriminates against it and will help rivals to emerge stronger, slash fares and swallow up others. The Irish company in February suffered a setback in the first two appeals, when the bloc’s lower court said French and Swedish subsidies didn’t violate EU state aid rules. It has vowed to appeal its first court losses to the EU’s top court. In France, Air France is being asked to give up 18 slots at Orly airport. Ryanair says that is nowhere near enough to allow others to offer a competitive challenge to its dominance. Air France-KLM has about 1,000 slots at Charles de Gaulle and Orly, the two Paris-area airports. In Germany, the terms of the bailout will do little to loosen Lufthansa’s iron grip on the country’s most lucrative airports and travel routes. While the Commission demanded Lufthansa ditch 24 slots at its two main German hubs, the takeoff and landing rights can’t go to companies that already have bases at those airports, stopping Ryanair from expanding in Frankfurt and Easyjet in Munich. Still, “carriers like Air France and Lufthansa have different strategic priorities than the short-haul low-cost carriers, and serve strategically important routes around the world,” said Darren Ellis, a lecturer in air transport management at Cranfield University. “If governments didn’t bail out the airlines, you’d hand over the long-haul market to state-backed carriers in other regions, including the Middle East.” Many see the presence of governments in the industry as a temporary phenomenon, with airlines likely to reduce their state reliance once travel picks up and the world heads into a post-pandemic normal. “Airlines have access to attractive financing that is better and less onerous than what governments can offer so when travel volumes come back, companies will have no interest in staying with the states.” said Yan Derocles, a Paris-based analyst at Oddo BHF. Still, some people are wary. “There’s an old French saying that goes: beware as the temporary can sometimes become the permanent,” said Jorge Guira, an associate professor of law at the University of Reading."

While Hong Kong has brought new cases down to practically zero, its draconian quarantine regime makes travel unappealing for  the masses. A plan for quarantine-free travel with Singapore was shelved after an outbreak there. Malaysia went into a two-week lockdown from June 1 following a jump in infections. Low vaccination rates haven’t helped get things moving.  “The slow rollout combined with a commendable but equally near impossible desire for a zero-based level of infections has resulted in authorities being ultra-cautious in their market reopening,” said Mayur Patel, head of Asia Pacific at OAG Aviation. “In Europe and North America, there is a much wider acceptance that we will have to learn to live with Covid as much as we live with other common diseases and viruses.” Like Taiwan, Singapore has long been lauded as one of the best places to be during the pandemic, only for infections to flare recently. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Monday that school children would be inoculated and every adult who wants a shot would have one by early August, pledging to not get left behind as the world begins to reemerge from the pandemic. “We will have to learn to carry on with our lives even with the virus in our midst,” Lee said in an address to the nation. Singapore is under tight social-distancing measures until June 13 following a recent outbreak. About 40% of the population has received at least a first vaccine dose. Almost  2 billion vaccines have been administered globally, with the U.S. and U.K. among those leading the way. China has given out more than 680 million doses, but rates are much lower in other parts of Asia, including tourist destinations Thailand and Vietnam, where enough shots have been given to cover only 2.6% and 0.6% of the populations, respectively. With summer holidays approaching in the northern hemisphere, global aviation capacity rose to almost 60% of 2019 levels -- a 3 percentage-point jump in a single week, the most in at least a month, according to Bloomberg’s weekly flight tracker, which uses OAG data to monitor the pulse of the comeback. Some markets even managed to claw back modest gains: Capacity in Russia has almost returned to 2019 levels, while Nigeria is up 7.3% from that year. The U.S. recovery picked up speed -- it’s now down 23% from 2019 levels. Memorial Day gave the U.S. a significant bounce, with airlines carrying the most passengers in almost 15 months on the Friday before the long weekend.By contrast, Asia — long the leader in the global aviation recovery — slipped again in recent weeks, falling behind the U.S. rebound, the data show. With an envious eye on vaccine progress and borders opening in other parts of the world, some businesses in Asia are rolling out unusual incentives to encourage people to get inoculated. Among them, a brand new, $1.4 million, 42-square-meter Hong Kong apartment is up for grabs in a lucky draw for vaccinated residents, while Australia’s Qantas Airways Ltd. is offering “mega prizes” including unlimited flights for a year. “The relatively slow pace of vaccinations continues to undermine the region’s economic recovery, in particular, the travel and tourism sectors,” Subhas Menon, director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, said Monday as data showed international air passenger volume in the region in April was 3.5% of the level reported in the same month in 2019. More Than 1.91 Billion Shots Given: Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker A Collinson survey of 46,830 people globally found about 78% of respondents would travel as long as more people get vaccinated, though it didn’t specify a number. People were also willing to use vaccine passports and take pre-departure tests if it meant they could travel. Quarantine was easily the biggest deterrent for respondents everywhere. Flights within Asia to popular beach and cultural destinations are still way off pre-pandemic levels, and in some cases have slid further since the start of 2021. Hong Kong-to-Bangkok flights have fallen by about 85% from their level this time two years ago. Singapore to the tropical Thai island of Phuket is even lower, though the route has picked up from the start of the year when there were no flights at all, Cirium data show. Bali routes have flatlined as the Indonesian island remains shut off to international arrivals.  Thailand has been battling to overcome virus outbreaks and revive tourism, a critical part of the Southeast Asian nation’s economy. Phuket is due to reopen to fully-vaccinated foreign visitors on July 1 — Qatar Airways for one said it will resume four weekly flights there — followed by other destinations in October. Even so, Thai authorities have warned it could take another  five years for tourism to fully recover in the country.  Cargo services out of Asia are proving more resilient thanks to continued demand for products from major exporters such as China and Japan. As Asia’s tourism recovery has stalled, restrictions are easing in places like Europe. That will bring challenges, with passenger traffic in the region set to almost triple from 47 million in May to 125 million in August, Airports Council International Europe said Monday. Managing the increase will “amount to an unprecedented operational challenge” due to factors including space constraints from physical distancing measures, longer passenger processing times and multiple Covid checks. While airlines and airports are grappling with the problems of too little service, for others there are concerns of being overwhelmed. “The level of both uncertainty and complexity in planning for the restart is just mind blowing for now,” ACI Europe Director General Olivier Jankovec said. “With each passing day, the prospect of travelers enduring widespread chaos at airports this summer is becoming more real.”"

The launch of flights to seven European cities from June 24 comes almost two years after Play was first conceived as a successor to Wow Air Hf, with several of its top executives having worked at the defunct discounter. The new venture is planning a rapid listing to raise as much as $20 million to fund U.S. routes. Play Air will launch with a single Airbus SE A321neo narrow-body followed by a further two before the end of July, leased from Dublin-based AerCap Holdings NV and previously operated by Mexico’s bankrupt Interjet. Three more jets will arrive next year to serve American cities and provide a one-stop link between the U.S. and Europe, Chief Executive Officer Birgir Jonsson said in an interview. “People learned a lot from the mistakes that were made at Wow,” said Jonsson, a former chief operating officer and deputy CEO at the failed carrier. “The idea is to utilize the experience the team gained there and mix it with new business and management experience to do things differently.” Sales have been brisk since tickets became available a week ago, he said, with strong bookings from locals to the Spanish sunspots of Tenerife and Alicante, as well as unexpectedly high demand from inbound tourists. Reservations stretch as far as Christmas and next Easter. Play Air’s debut flight will be to London Stansted, taking advantage of Iceland’s inclusion among a handful of nations from which Britain is allowing quarantine-free travel. That reflects the North Atlantic island’s success in managing the pandemic, with the infection rate consistently among Europe’s lowest. The carrier secured $50 million in new funds in April from Icelandic financial institutions. Its biggest backer remains investment group Fea, led by Elias Skúli Skúlason, whose Airport Associates provides ground-handling services at the nation’s main Keflavik airport. Play Air is planning an initial public offering at the end of next month on the Nasdaq First North Iceland market, according to Jonsson, seeking to raise between $10 million and $20 million. The CEO, who took over last month with the backing of the new investors, said there’s room for a further airline serving the country of just 350,000 people, despite competition from flag-carrier Icelandair and foreign operators including Wizz Air Holdings Plc and U.S. giant Delta Air Lines Inc., which commenced services after Iceland opened up to vaccinated Americans. Jonsson points to startups in Norway, where Norse Atlantic Airways, founded by executives with ties to Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, aims to offer trans-Atlantic flights, and another new venture, Flyr AS, is targeting short-haul routes. Wow made a mistake in expanding beyond its original low-cost model to add long-haul services with an Airbus A330 wide-body jet, he said in separate comments at the virtual Future Travel Experience conference Tuesday. Linking secondary cities in Europe and the U.S. that have no direct flights -- making a change of plane a necessity rather than an unwelcome diversion -- will be a key element of Play Air’s strategy once demand revives, he said."

The U.K.’s latest clampdown on air travel was met with alarm by industry executives, who called the restrictions complex and said they fear a worsening struggle for survival. Health Secretary Matt Hancock outlined details of new restrictions, including a hotel quarantine and multiple Covid-19 tests, coming into force from Feb. 15 in an attempt to prevent dangerous new virus strains entering the country. WATCH: U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announces new quarantine measures on Tuesday. (Source: Bloomberg) Holiday Giant TUI Counts on U.K. Vaccines to Rescue Summer Brace Yourself: Long-Haul Travel Might Not Start Until 2023 U.K. Officials Fear South Africa Strain Could Risk Recovery But key aspects of the policy’s implementation weren’t spelled out, leaving executives in the travel industry guessing. Each traveler arriving in England from 33 nations on the government’s “red list” will be forced to pay as much as 1,750 pounds ($2,410) to isolate in a hotel for 10 days. They will also be required to test negative for Covid-19 three times. More testing “adds a further barrier to viable air travel and deepens the worsening 2021 outlook for our sector,” Karen Dee, chief executive officer of the Airport Operators Association, and Tim Alderslade, who leads Airlines UK, said in a statement. “Airports and airlines are battling to survive with almost zero revenue and a huge cost base, and practically every week a further blow lands.” The government still hasn’t made it clear who will be responsible for shepherding high-risk passengers through the airport and to the quarantine hotels, people with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified before decisions are finalized. Airports want financial aid if they are expected to do this, and are asking for details on how these passengers will be separated from others as they make their way through the airport, the people said. The travel industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus and has had to contend with sudden changes to rules as the government attempts to get a handle on the risk posed by new variants of the virus. The U.K. has lagged behind other countries in imposing tighter border restrictions, with countries such as Australia bringing in mandatory quarantine months ago. In their statement, the airport and airline lobbies called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to provide a road map for a return to international travel with “transparent and risk-based health criteria” for the lifting of restrictions. They also said aviation-specific financial aid is urgently needed. “U.K. aviation can be the conduit to the government’s Global Britain and leveling-up agendas, but only if we have viable and competitive sector still standing come the end of the pandemic,” they said. The government has signed contracts with 16 hotels near London’s Gatwick and Heathrow airports, and Birmingham in central England, to provide 4,600 rooms so far. More rooms will be booked as needed, Hancock said. Westminster is in contact with authorities in Scotland and Ireland, and measures will apply to British and Irish residents returning home from virus hot spots. “We must strengthen our defenses yet further,” Hancock said. “People who flout these rules are putting us all at risk.” Under the plans for tighter border rules: While the travel industry decried the lack of detail in the policy, opposition politicians and others criticized ministers for taking too long to close border loopholes for travelers. The new policy will come into force almost three weeks after it was announced and the number of hotel rooms secured so far falls well short of the 28,000 reported to be the government’s target. British officials have spoken to their Australian and New Zealand counterparts for advice about how to quarantine travelers in hotels. More than 112,000 people in the U.K. have died from coronavirus, compared with 909 in Australia. Johnson’s government is still resisting a blanket hotel quarantine policy in an effort to minimize disruption to vital supplies and essential travel. In Parliament, Mark Harper, a Conservative former minister, urged Hancock to spell out when the rules will be lifted. Hancock replied that the rules will be replaced “over time” once the population has been vaccinated. All passengers arriving in England will be required by law to take further coronavirus tests on day 2 and day 8 of their quarantine Arrivals failing to take tests will face 1,000-pound fines, while those arriving from hot spot countries who breach their hotel quarantine will be fined as much as 10,000 pounds Anyone caught lying on the passenger forms and trying to conceal they have been in a country on the red list in the 10 days before arrival will face a prison sentence of as long as 10 years Police and border officials will conduct checks to ensure compliance"

Even so, the U.S. as a whole is on course for the fewest weekly infections since early October. Nationwide air travel reached 1.35 million people on Friday, a record during the pandemic. A measure that would allow Kentuckians to refuse any vaccine for a “conscientiously held belief” cleared the state House Friday and is headed for likely passage next week in the Kentucky Senate. “This is not about the Covid-19 vaccine; it’s about any vaccine,” outspoken anti-vaccination advocate State Representative Savannah Maddox said during floor debate Friday. The bill would eliminate state health officials’ ability to mandate vaccines in response to a future pandemic. Democratic Governor Andy Beshear has repeatedly stated that his administration wouldn’t require vaccination against Covid-19. The legislature is controlled by Republicans. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his colleagues from the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia and Latvia are demanding a European Union summit on what they claim is uneven distribution of vaccines in the bloc. Their demand, set out in a letter to EU Council President Charles Michel, comes after Kurz complained Friday that some countries get more than others and that there’s an opaque “bazaar” for doses. An outbreak has hit a New Hampshire nursing home where most of the residents and staff have been vaccinated, the Union Leader reported. The state has reported 11 cases among residents and five among staff members at the facility owned by Alpine Healthcare. The outbreak comes several weeks after the facility began limited visitations, the newspaper reported. More than 800 of New Hampshire’s total 1,189 deaths since the pandemic began have occurred at long-term care facilities, state data show. Norway, among the countries that have suspended the use of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine, said three people who received the shot are being treated for severe blood clots and cerebral hemorrhages but said it was too soon to say if there was a connection. The people, who were all “of younger age,” had a reduced number of platelets in the blood, the Norwegian Medicines Agency said in a statement on Saturday. Hospitalizations for Covid-19 in New York state, which has been battling the highest number in the U.S., fell further to 4,617, Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. That number has declined by 337 in the last week, he said. The state reported 6,600 new cases, among the lowest for any day this year. The statewide positive test rate fell slightly to 2.92%. Another 77 people died, he said. U.S. air travel reached 1.35 million people on Friday, a record since the pandemic descended in mid-March a year ago, according to data from the Transportation Security Administration. Air travel is still down more than 40% compared with the equivalent Friday in 2019. Hong Kong abruptly locked down four buildings in the heart of a popular expatriate residential area, taking one of its most dramatic steps yet to contain a super-spreading event that began in a gym and put many of the city’s elite and their families on edge. Authorities cordoned off two towers each at the Robinson Place and Blessings Garden residential complexes in the exclusive Mid-Levels neighborhood, according to a government statement Saturday. All residents will be required to be tested at mobile testing stations before 2 a.m. Sunday and the lockdown will likely be lifted by 9 a.m., it said. The U.S. added 57,741 new cases Friday, near the end of a week on track to end at the lowest level since the beginning of October, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg show. The average number of daily cases over the last week has fallen 15% compared with the previous week. Another 1,648 deaths were reported, with average daily fatalities dropping more than 20% from the prior week. While cases have fallen below the peak of last summer’s surge, deaths remain above that level. The World Trade Organization’s new leader, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, urged vaccine manufacturers to extend licenses to other companies to aid the rollout in poorer nations. There are more than 130 nations without a single dose, she told German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. She also called for the abolition of export restrictions on medical goods, such as those imposed in the EU. The U.K. is on course to offer every adult a vaccination by June 10, beating a government target and about two months ahead of the European Union, the Times reported, citing researcher Airfinity. Separately, the Telegraph said everyone over the age of 40 should be offered their first shot by early April, with a supply boost allowing the program to expand next week. That will put pressure on the government to speed up the relaxation of lockdowns, it said. Germany reported 12,700 new virus cases, the second-highest daily figure since the start of March, and the country’s seven-day incidence rate per 100,000 people climbed to the highest in more than a month. On Friday, the head of the Robert Koch Institute warned that Germany is at the start of a third wave of infections, just as the government has started lifting some lockdown restrictions. The number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care reached a record high 989 on Friday, as the nation struggles with the spread of a British variant. Hungary closed schools, nurseries and non-essential stores on Monday, and 1.3 million of the country’s 10 million have received at least on vaccination shot. Norway, among the countries that have suspended the use of AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine, said three people who received the shot are being treated for severe blood clots and cerebral hemorrhages but said it was too soon to say if there was a connection.

China said it will ease visa application requirements for foreigners seeking to enter the mainland from Hong Kong if they have been inoculated with Covid-19 vaccines made in China.  The change comes as China has been promoting its home-grown shots globally amid competition from western vaccines. Foreigners visiting the mainland for work will face less paperwork in visa applications if they are able to show they have received vaccines produced in China and can skip the requirement for a Covid-19 test.  California reported 217 more deaths from Covid-19 yesterday, for a total of 55,095, according to the health department’s website. There were 3,230 new cases reported, as the outbreak eased enough for the state to relax restrictions in 13 counties including Los Angeles, starting Sunday. The seven-day positive test rate hovered at 2.1%, down 0.2% from the previous period. California has administered more than 11.4 million vaccines in total. Australia and Singapore have held talks about allowing travel between them by nationals of the two countries who have had Covid-19 vaccinations, The Age reported, citing Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan. “Singapore are very keen to work with Australia on a proof of vaccination certificate and we agreed our officials should work together on this,” Tehan said, according to the Melbourne-based newspaper. Detroit, Baltimore and Phoenix recorded the biggest percentage increases in Covid-19 cases during the week ended Thursday, according to a list of major metro areas tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ranking next were San Juan, Puerto Rico, Minneapolis and Nashville, Tennessee. New York City stagnated, while Houston, Atlanta and Dallas showed the biggest declines compared to the previous week. Fifteen of 20 U.S. urban areas with populations between 250,000 and more than 1 million showed a decrease, according to the CDC. St. Cloud, Minnesota, led increases in a group of smaller cities with a 125% jump. The data, which ranks cities with high or increasing case burdens, don’t include Los Angeles and Chicago.

The lawsuit set to be filed on Thursday will seek more clarity about how the government assesses the risk of visiting other countries, Manchester Airports Group said. The suit, which has support from other airlines, comes as the U.K. considers revisions that will make travel easier for vaccinated people, according to a person familiar with the matter. The conflict follows the U.K.’s abrupt decision earlier this month to remove Portugal from the so-called green list of countries residents can visit without quarantine on return. The southern European country was the only significant destination green-lit at the time, and the move forced some travelers to return from holidays on short notice. Airline shares rose on reports that the U.K. was considering changes to the system. The government may do away with quarantine requirements for vaccinated travelers returning from amber-listed places, a person familiar with the matter said. Ryanair gained as much as 4.3% in Dublin. Discount rival EasyJet Plc addeds as much as 4.6% and British Airways parent IAG SA gained up to 3.9%. Despite a rapid vaccine rollout, the U.K. has pulled back on its reopening plans as it fights an outbreak of the delta virus variant that first arose in India. The industry suit will argue that decisions on how countries are categorized have been taken in an opaque manner. Under the traffic-light system, travelers from territories that are listed green don’t need to quarantine upon arrival in the U.K., although Covid-19 tests are mandatory. Places listed amber and red require isolation at home or in a hotel. The U.K. aviation industry has long decried the current system as arbitrary, and sought clearer criteria on categorizations. Carriers are desperately trying to salvage the usually lucrative summer season, after 15 straight months with very little flying. The U.K.’s caution contrasts with the European Union, which is set to reopen travel within the bloc on July 1, with airlines shifting capacity to the continent as some countries move ahead of the deadline. Relative to the U.K., “I have pointed out the obvious fact that they are not looking at the data, they are not taking decisions on the data that very clearly says that you can travel safely to these destinations,” EasyJet Chief Executive Officer Johan Lundgren said in an interview this week. The Telegraph reported earlier that the U.K. is considering scrapping the quarantine requirement for travelers who have received two vaccine doses and are returning from amber-list countries. They would still have to be tested."

Variants now make up 85% of present cases in Minnesota. Israel has found a probable link between the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine and cases of heart inflammation in young men. The European Union passed 250 million vaccinations and is on track to reach its target of inoculating 70% of adults in July, according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The number of new cases is dropping in Minnesota, but an estimated 85% of have been traced to emerging variants of the virus, which have also sent a higher percentage of people to hospitals, said Kris Ehresmann, Minnesota Department of Health infectious disease director. Viruses constantly change through mutation and new variants of the virus that causes Covid-19 that were first identified in Brazil, India, U.K. and other countries are now spreading within the state, but not through exposure to travelers, Ehresmann said. “What we’ve been seeing is less evidence of international travel and more evidence that these variants are now circulating within the communities” of the state, Ehresmann said. Minnesota’s statewide case rate is currently 9.7 new daily cases per 100,000 residents, the lowest since July 2020, she said. Brazil’s Health Ministry said it expects to receive 39.8 million doses of vaccines in June, 3.9 million fewer than it had forecast, O Globo reported, without saying how it got the information. Until last week, the federal government expected to receive about 43.8 million vaccines in June. The estimated delivery of CoronaVac fell to 5 million doses from 6 million previously, while the forecast for AstraZeneca/Oxford shots was reduced to 18 million from 20.9 million. South Africa’s Department of Health said the positivity rate of Covid-19 tests has risen to 12.7% and the country had 5,782 new confirmed infections over the last 24 hours. “We will be monitoring this increase in positivity rate to see if it sustains,” the department said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that the surge in cases was highest in Gauteng province, the country’s commercial hub. South Africa has vaccinated just over 1.1 million of its 60 million people. New Jersey will close all six of its vaccine mega-sites by July 23 as demand wanes and the state nears its goal of immunizing 70% of residents. “We’re localizing and this is yet another step in that direction,” Governor Phil Murphy said at a streaming virus update. Health officials now will encourage vaccine seekers to make arrangements at any of almost 1,800 sites, including pharmacies, retailers and community medical centers. The mega-sites at their height were processing 400 or more recipients per hour on an appointments-only basis, for almost 1 million people in all. Each now takes walk-ins. New Jersey, with 9.2 million residents, intends to fully vaccinate 4.7 million people by June 30. The state is at 90% of that goal. Free child care will be available during vaccine appointments as part of new incentives to reach President Joe Biden’s target of getting 70% of U.S. adults at least partially vaccinated by July 4, according to a statement from the White House. Other new initiatives include offering shots at Black-owned barber shops and beauty salons as well as private-sector incentives such as free beer from Anheuser-Busch. Biden is calling for a national month of action to get more people vaccinated. Portugal will no longer require people to work remotely as it continues to ease confinement measures after the number of new Covid-19 cases eased and the vaccination campaign advances. While working from home will no longer be mandatory from June 14, it will still be recommended, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said at a press conference in Lisbon on Wednesday. Restrictions on opening hours for shops will be lifted and restaurants can remain open until 1 a.m. Bars and nightclubs will remain closed, he said. Portugal reported 724 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, a fraction of the daily record of more than 16,000 cases reported at the end of January, when the country faced one of the world’s worst outbreaks. The country aimsto administer at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose to 70% of its adult population by Aug. 8. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city would launch in-school vaccination sites in partnership with the United Federation of Teachers, the city’s largest teachers union, starting on Friday. The program will begin with four schools in the Bronx and expand to all five boroughs in the next few weeks. New York is outpacing the nation in vaccinating young people, de Blasio said at a briefing Wednesday. Nearly 120,000 kids in New York City age 12-17 have been vaccinated, or about 23% of the population, which surpasses the national average of 22%, he said. Burkina Faso, one of the last countries in the world to start administering Covid-19 vaccines, launched its inoculation campaign Tuesday. Health Minister Charlemagne Ouedraogo got the West African nation’s first jab in the capital, Ouagadougou, after a first shipment of 115,000 AstraZeneca shots arrived Sunday through the Covax facility, backed by the World Health Organization. Boris Johnson indicated his government remains on course to lift lockdown restrictions this month, a day after the U.K. recorded no new Covid-19 deaths for the first time. “I can see nothing in the data at the moment that means we cannot go ahead,” the British prime minister said in a pooled interview Wednesday. “But we’ve got to be so cautious,” he warned, given the recent rise in infections. Tuesday’s milestone has bolstered calls from business and members of Johnson’s Conservative Party for the government to proceed with the fourth and final stage of unlocking the economy on June 21. Singapore will allow the use of Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s vaccine, after the World Health Organization approved the drug as part of its emergency use listing. Serbia is offering free vaccines to visitors from neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Aleksandar Vucic told reporters in Belgrade on Wednesday. “We’ve got as many vaccines as you need,” Vucic said after meeting officials from the neighboring country. “We were hoping for a better response from our citizens.” Serbia pulled off one of the fastest inoculation campaigns in Europe, though the pace has slowed recently. The Balkan country has inoculated almost half of its population of 7 million, including 2.1 million with both doses. The government has already donated more than 100,000 vaccines to neighboring countries. The European Union passed 250 million vaccinations on Wednesday. The bloc is on track to reach its target of vaccinating 70% of its adult population in July, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a tweet. More than 80 million people living in the EU have been fully vaccinated, she added. Germany will probably need to buy Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine to help complete its inoculation drive, according to a regional minister. Officials are conducting “intensive talks” on buying the shot, but the approval process is being delayed as some documents requested from Russia haven’t been provided, Harry Glawe, minister of economy, labor and health in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, said at a Russian-German business forum. Earlier, Health Minister Jens Spahn said Germany has begun preparations to block a potential “fourth wave” from materializing after the summer. Spahn said he has initiated discussions with experts from the RKI public-health institute on how the nation can be better prepared than in the previous wave. Malaysia reported a record 126 deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday as the Southeast Asian nation entered the second day of a two-week hard lockdown. The tally pushed Malaysia’s total death toll to 2,993, more than half of which occurred last month. HSBC Holdings Plc is giving some of its French staff two options to work from home part-time. Employees can decide between occasional remote working, with as many as 30 days per year away from the office, and frequent remote work, with either 8 or 12 days per month at home, according to a spokeswoman. HSBC is also among major banks and brokers operating in Hong Kong that are doling out cash credits, free stocks and days off to get more people vaccinated after authorities in the financial hub leaned on companies to revive a faltering inoculation drive. Hong Kong’s expert advisory panel on Covid vaccinations, meanwhile, has agreed to expand eligibility to children as young as 12, according to a person familiar with the matter. The delta variant, first identified in India, is a “scariant being used to urge caution,” Ryanair Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Michael O’Leary said in an interview with Sky News, calling on the U.K. government to lift travel restrictions to Europe. Prime Minister Boris Johnson indicated that Britain remains on course to lift restrictions this month, but he urged caution. Germany is exploring ways to prevent a potential new wave after the summer, and it will probably need to buy Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, officials said.

The airline industry’s chief lobby group widened its estimate for losses this year by about a quarter, saying new Covid-19 flare-ups and mutations have pushed back the timeline for a restart of global air travel. Carriers will lose about $48 billion in 2021, the International Air Transport Association said Wednesday in an online presentation. It had earlier forecast a $38 billion deficit. Regional Highlights of the IATA forecast: “This crisis is longer and deeper than anyone could have expected,” said Willie Walsh, the former chief of British Airways owner IAG SA, who’s now IATA’s director general. “Losses will be reduced from 2020, but the pain of the crisis increases.” The downward pivot comes as airlines contend with new travel bans and restrictions arising from outbreaks in large aviation markets such as India and Brazil. Governments of countries that have ramped up vaccinations most quickly have become cautious about restarting travel to prevent the import of new variants that could prove resistant to jabs. This week, the U.S. State Department said it would declare about 80% of the world’s nations no-go zones. In Europe, the U.K. has held off on confirming a plan to restart travel in mid-May, saying it will decide closer to the date. While some countries are starting to open up to vaccinated tourists, progress toward so-called vaccine passports has proven slow and complex. After the industry lost about $126 billion in the teeth of the crisis during 2020, there were high hopes for a rebound in air travel during the first half of this year. IATA now says the crucial summer season is at risk. Demand will reach 43% of 2019 levels during 2021 -- a more optimistic outlook than issued in February, but less bullish than in December, when vaccines were first being rolled out. At that time IATA saw traffic this year recovering to about half of pre-pandemic levels. Industry break even, previously expected in the fourth quarter, will now be delayed into 2022. Read: U.S. Airlines’ Summer Dreams at Risk on Blanket No-Go Advice In the U.S., investors have turned sour on the chance of a quick recovery in aviation, sending a Standard & Poor’s index of major airlines to 10 straight days of declines this month, the longest streak since at least 1989. In Europe, trans-Atlantic specialist Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. said Wednesday that it won’t get its fleet fully back in the air until October or November. The new estimates assume a partial reopening of some markets in Europe in time for summer flying, and also of some trans-Atlantic services, IATA Chief Economist Brian Pearce said. These routes should be fully open in the fourth quarter, with more than 75% of relevant populations vaccinated, he said. While optimism for the second half hinges mainly on the continuing rebound of large domestic markets like the U.S. and China, Walsh said he’s a little more upbeat about Europe than IATA’s official projections. Testing of the group’s Travel Pass app is continuing with more than 50 airlines signed up. North American carriers are best placed to take advantage of rapid vaccination programs because of the large domestic U.S. market. Losses lowest globally as a proportion of revenue Testing and increasing the pace of an unsteady vaccine roll-out are key to the recovery of the struggling European market. Losses will be reduced at the slowest rate in this region Asia-Pacific carriers see 45% of traffic coming from domestic markets, driven by Chinese market recovery, together with booming cargo sector Middle Eastern demand will benefit from high vaccination rates in home markets, offset by continued travel restrictions on routes to emerging economies served through Gulf hubs"

Falling out with Qatar Airways, Al Baker warned, will cause Airbus “a stress in the relationship with IAG, with LatAm, with other airlines in which we have a shareholding.” The subject of the spat? “I unfortunately cannot tell you what that issue is,” Al Baker said. Airbus won’t say either. A spokesperson for the Blagnac, France-based company said it’s in constant talks with customers about their requirements, and that details on those discussions “remain confidential.” Qatar Airways is among Airbus’s most important customers, particularly as the manufacturer considers competing with U.S. rival Boeing Co. by moving into marketing cargo carriers. It’s a position that has allowed Al Baker to put pressure on Airbus or lampoon the company in public, from threatening to cancel orders or delay deliveries to accusing Airbus of being incapable of building planes. The airline chief previously criticized Airbus’s giant A380 jets over their inefficiency and operational cost. However, he told Bloomberg TV that was “water under the bridge” and not the subject of the latest dispute. The CEO said in January only half of its 10 A380s would return to service after being grounded in 2020. Qatar wields an outsize influence in the industry because of its stakes in other major airlines, including British-Airways parent IAG. The row with Qatar comes as Airbus looks to ramp up jet-making to help rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic, which grounded a large portion of air travel worldwide. The company said last week it’s looking to boost production of its best-selling A320-series jets beyond pre-pandemic levels within two years, sending waves of optimism around the industry. Read More: Airbus Sets Plan to Boost Output, Igniting Aerospace Rally The carrier has leaned on its diverse fleet to keep flying during the pandemic and expects to service more than 140 destinations by mid-summer. Smaller planes have allowed the carriers to fly with fewer passengers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s even added a handful of new routes to its roster, including Seattle and San Francisco. Staying in the air hasn’t come cheap. Al Baker said the airline accepted $3 billion in support from the Qatari government since the start of the pandemic. The state-run carrier received its first injection of aid after its losses topped 50% of share capital last year. Qatar’s expecting to take delivery of planes from Airbus and Boeing Co. this year, Al Baker said, after a strident campaign to defer deliveries from both companies last year. Al Baker also said the Doha-based carrier will be the launch customer for Boeing’s highly anticipated 777x in 2023, backtracking on comments made just last week saying it wouldn’t. Qatar Airways has ordered 60 of the new model, which is being billed as the “world’s largest and most efficient twin-engine jet.” The forced landing of a Ryanair Holdings Plc jet flying over Belarus “is something that should have never happened,” Al Baker said. He warned it could “create a precedent” for other countries. Still, Qatar Airways isn’t stopping flights over the country. “As far as we are concerned, for us it’s business as usual.” Acquisitions are on hold for now, beyond an ongoing investment in Rwandair that was announced in early 2020. “I don’t think it is the right time to invest in any carrier,” Al Baker said, citing ongoing uncertainty around the pandemic. The situation is so “unpredictable that we don’t know how to plan.” Qatar is still considering a long-discussed investment in Indian carrier Indigo when “the conditions are correct,” he said. Before the pandemic, Qatari officials had projected that as many as 1.5 million people could visit the tiny Gulf country for the 2022 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament. That’s still possible due to vaccine rollouts and development of drug therapies to treat Covid-19, said Al Baker, who’s also head of Qatar’s National Tourism Council."

Under the new rules coming into force at 4 a.m. U.K. time on Friday, anyone who is not a British or Irish national or has U.K. residence rights will be refused entry to Britain if they have been in India in the last 10 days. The ban is necessary to “protect the progress we’ve made in this country in tackling this awful disease,” Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons on Monday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had earlier canceled a visit to India planned for next week, during which he had been due to meet his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi. Coronavirus cases hit a record in India over the weekend, fueled by the emergence of a new variant. Hancock said health authorities had so far identified 103 cases of the variant in the U.K., the “vast majority” linked to international travel. Samples are being analysed for any “concerning characteristics,” he said. Researchers are investigating how transmissible the variant is, as well as its potential ability to evade vaccines. Officials still call it a “variant under investigation” rather than one “of concern,” and surge testing is being carried out in the U.K. to try and contain its spread. Asked whether vaccines were effective against the new variant, Hancock told members of Parliament: “We simply don’t know that. We’re acting on a precautionary basis.” He said the core concern is “the vaccines may be less effective in terms of transmission and/or in terms of reducing hospitalization and death.” India is one of the world’s largest markets for air travel and has strong links to the U.K. population dating back to the British colonial era. The South Asian country had generally fared well in keeping the infection rates down, until recently. It now has the world’s fastest-growing Covid-19 caseload, adding 273,810 new infections and 1,619 deaths on Monday, leaving it behind only the U.S. in terms of total numbers. “India is a country I know well and love,” Hancock said. “Between our two countries we have ties of friendship and family. I understand the impact of this decision but I hope the House will concur that we must act.” There’s a New Virus Variant in India. How Worried Should We Be? Adding India to the so-called red list means that any British citizen who does return to the U.K. will need to quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days, which can cost as much as 1,750 pounds ($2,450). The U.K.’s decision follows similar action by Hong Kong, which banned flights from India for 14 days from April 20 after dozens of passengers from New Delhi tested positive for Covid-19 in Hong Kong, the Press Trust of India reported Saturday. Carriers including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd., Air India and India’s Vistara currently operate services between cities in India and the U.K. The United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Brazil, South Africa and Philippines are among other countries that are on the U.K.’s red list. While travel from the U.K. is currently banned for most people until at least May 17 under the country’s lockdown rules, flights have continued operating for those exempt from the rules. Earlier on Monday, Johnson told broadcasters it was “sensible” to postpone his India trip given the shape of the pandemic there.” He said he planned to speak with Modi virtually and hoped he would attend the Group of Seven summit of world leaders in the U.K. in June. While Johnson’s predecessor, former Prime Minister David Cameron, pursued a strategy of increased trade ties with both India and China, relations with Beijing have soured in recent months -- placing diplomacy with New Delhi at the heart of Britain’s plans."

U.S. Airlines’ Summer Dreams at Risk,[],,"As carriers ramp up, Washington says travel warnings will cover 80% of the world’s nations.  A passenger arrives for a United Airlines flight at O’Hare International Airport on Feb. 5 in Chicago.  Just this week, the U.S. State Department said it would declare about 80% of the world’s nations no-go zones. That’s made it harder for airlines to claw back overseas travel that includes more lucrative business-class seats. American is  planning to fly more than 90% of its 2019 domestic seat capacity and 80% of international this summer, even as new virus variants threaten the recovery. Delta says travelers are “beginning to reclaim their lives.” United Airlines Holdings Inc. is showing more caution but still expects to fly more than half its pre-pandemic schedule this quarter.  With the comeback limited to vacationers taking domestic trips or flying to nearby foreign destinations such as Mexico, discounters like Spirit Airlines Inc. and Frontier Group Holdings Inc. stand to benefit at the expense of big carriers. “Intrinsically, domestic flying does not make a profit,” said John Grant, chief analyst at OAG. “It is a lot more marginal than international flying where you've got lots of business travelers in business class paying expensive fares.” Using weekly OAG data, Bloomberg has built a global flight tracker to monitor the pulse of the air travel comeback. The latest update shows a modest decrease in U.S. capacity after earlier gains fueled by spring break and Easter. As a percentage of 2019 traffic, the U.S. continues to trail such major markets as China and India while leading Europe. Another wild card is pricing. Domestic coach fares in March were about a third lower than their level two years earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the summer, however, “average U.S. ticket prices seem broadly in line with 2019,” said Matt Bradford, a spokesman for flight-search website Skyscanner. The plunge in traffic over the Atlantic and the Pacific reflects in part the demise of corporate travel. Tickets sold for business trips are down 78% from 2019 levels, compared with the 47% average decline for all segments, according to travel data firm Airlines Reporting Corp. By contrast, ski trips during spring break helped bring smaller markets in the mountain states of Montana and Wyoming back to within 20% of pre-pandemic levels. Airport passenger counts in California dropped 63% for the month of March, while New York and New Jersey were down 66% and 53%, respectively. During normal times, John F. Kennedy International, Newark Liberty and Los Angeles International are among the nation’s busiest airports for overseas travel. Traffic in states with big domestic hubs — like Texas, Florida, Illinois and Georgia — fell somewhere in the middle of the spectrum.  These days, instead of ferrying high-dollar business flyers to London or Tokyo, U.S. airlines are left to focus on how to entice more budget-conscious leisure travelers. To energize its international business, United is trying to tap Americans’ pent-up wanderlust with new seasonal flights to Iceland, Greece and Croatia. American, which is cutting back flights to South America amid the worsening pandemic in Brazil, is bolstering the domestic schedule — for example, with service to Orlando, Florida, from eight U.S. cities this summer. “If you’re a U.S. airline, you’ve been able to recover some of that lost international demand by people being attracted to go to the southern states, to points like Florida, or Arizona or if they could do California,” OAG’s Grant said. While there are positive signs, “it still requires access to major international markets to solidify the recovery we've seen today.” American Airlines Group Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. are among the carriers that have added capacity in recent weeks, based on a Bloomberg analysis of data from flight-tracking specialist OAG."

Pelosi’s receptiveness to stand-alone legislation for airlines doesn’t appear to include other elements of what was to have been a comprehensive relief package, however. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, she rejected pressure from Trump to green-light a bill authorizing $1,200 individual stimulus checks, saying that was insufficient to address the Covid-19 challenge. With regard to carriers, Mnuchin “inquired about a standalone airlines bill” in a phone call with Pelosi Wednesday morning, her spokesman Drew Hammill tweeted. “The speaker reminded him that Republicans blocked that bill on Friday & asked him to review the DeFazio bill so that they could have an informed conversation.” The two spoke again Wednesday evening for about 20 minutes about airline aid, and Hammill said they agreed to talk again on Thursday. Mnuchin’s call underscores the Trump administration’s concern about the state of the airline industry, which has been walloped by the Covid-19 crisis and seen tens of thousands of job cuts. Help for the carriers had been part of the broader stimulus negotiations that Trump abruptly ended Tuesday. An S&P 500 gauge of airline stocks rose 2.8% as of 12:21 p.m. in New York, paring an earlier gain of as much as 4.3%. House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio on Friday attempted to pass an extension of expiring aid for airlines on the House floor by unanimous consent, but Republicans objected, saying they hadn’t been consulted. Democratic leaders have generally opposed pursuing a series of stand-alone measures. That would erode any leverage to secure the level of spending they want for state and local government aid, food assistance, unemployment insurance and other priorities, Democrats say. “We don’t have time to save the economy piece by piece. As Fed Chairman Powell told us, we need to act now and act big,” said House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth. Federal Reserve officials led by Chairman Jerome Powell this week stepped up their calls for a broad relief package to help the unemployed and endangered businesses, highlighting concern about undermining the economic recovery. During an appearance Wednesday on ABC’s “The View,” Pelosi didn’t explicitly shut the door on continuing negotiations with Trump and the administration, or potential measures focused on new stimulus checks, aid for airlines or other issues. But she did disparage the idea of just sending stimulus checks without the other relief Democrats have been seeking. Trump in a late Tuesday tweet suggested the House should begin passing White House priorities such as the $1,200 checks per individual, unencumbered by Democratic priorities. “Well it’s hard to see any clear sane path in anything that he is doing. But the fact is, is that he saw the political downside of his statement of walking away from the negotiations,” said Pelosi of Trump. “All he has ever wanted in negotiation was to send out a check with his name printed on it. Forget about the virus.” Pelosi reiterated her opposition to the idea of some relief being better than no relief, when asked whether she ought to have done more to compromise with the White House. “No, I don’t think so. I think it is a missed opportunity,” said Pelosi, noting that she and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had lowered by $1.2 trillion the price-tag of their proposed stimulus package. “You should ask them why they don’t want to put food on the table, rent in the pockets of the American people, crush the virus, support our heroes, and the rest.” The DeFazio legislation would provide more than $28 billion for airlines and contractors if they held off on layoffs until March 31, 2021. U.S. carriers have furloughed about 38,000 people since Oct. 1, including major layoffs at American Airlines Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. Those cuts followed the departure of 150,000 who left airlines voluntarily or accepted leave. Pelosi last week urged the airlines to postpone layoffs, promising that relief was imminent. “We will either enact Chairman DeFazio’s bipartisan stand-alone legislation or achieve this as part of a comprehensive negotiated relief bill, extending for another six months the Payroll Support Program,” she said in a statement on Friday. Republicans at the time said the DeFazio bill had been sprung on them without a budget score, and they pointed to an alternative bill sponsored by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker. That Republican bill funded aid for carriers using unspent stimulus money from earlier in the year earmarked for defense contractors and related businesses. A House companion version has 100 sponsors and co-sponsors, including dozens of Democrats.

A month earlier, anti-government protests had exploded across the country over taxes and a deteriorating currency crisis. Amid such uncertainty, few people visited his guesthouse. Then came the coronavirus and subsequent government-imposed lockdowns. The guesthouse officially closed its doors in February 2020. A year and a half later, he still has no plans to reopen amid the country’s current financial meltdown. “Corona really affected us, but the biggest thing was the currency crisis,” Mershad said, speaking at his home above the guesthouse. “We used to offer meals for guests with Nescafe, tea, whatever they wanted for a cheap price. Now, one hamburger patty costs that much."" The dual shocks of the pandemic and a devastating financial crisis have gutted the hospitality sector of this Mediterranean nation, known for its beaches, mountain resorts and good food. Hundreds of businesses, including guesthouses like the Mershad Guesthouse, have been forced to close. But as pandemic restrictions are being eased, the businesses that survived hope the dollars spent by visiting Lebanese expats and an increase in domestic tourism can get the wheels of the economy moving again. Currently, most hotel reservations are from Lebanese expats and some foreigners from neighboring Iraq, Egypt and Jordan. Airport arrivals are picking up: Every day for the past several weeks, the Beirut Airport has had four flights coming from Iraq, with more than 700 passengers in total, according to Jean Abboud, president of the Travel and Tourist Agents Union. Chaotic scenes have been reported at the arrivals lounge as people crowd for the obligatory PCR test. Many Lebanese who traditionally vacationed abroad over the summer are now turning to domestic tourism. It's the more practical option because of travel restrictions, dollars trapped in banks and a lack of functioning credit cards. “In the past two years, the country has radically changed. It is no longer a destination for nightlife, for city tourism and for the things that people knew. There’s ... more interest from the Lebanese to travel inside their country,” said Joumana Brihi, board member of the Lebanese Mountain Trail Association. The association maintains a 290-mile (470-kilometer) hiking trail spanning the country from north to south. Many in the industry say the number of domestic tourists has increased significantly since the country’s lockdown eased in April. They expect to see expats piling in and spending this summer despite the instability, partly because of the devalued Lebanese pound. That will save a lot of places from shutting down or “at least prolong the life of some businesses,” said Maya Noun, general secretary of the syndicate of restaurant owners. Since October 2019, Lebanon's currency has lost more than 90% of its value, trading at around 17,000 Lebanese pounds to the dollar on the black market. The official exchange rate remains at 1,507 pounds to the dollar. Last year, Member of Parliament Michel Daher was chastised on social media for saying on TV that “Lebanon is really cheap, in every sense,” because of the crumbling currency. “People were laughing at me then,” Daher told The Associated Press. “Now, there are lots of Lebanese expats coming because of the prices, but we also want foreigners."" Still, the scene on the ground is no picturesque vacation destination. Electricity cuts last much of the day and privately run generators have had to be turned off for several hours to ration fuel. The country suffers from a shortage of vital products, including medicine, medical products and gasoline. For weeks, frustrated citizens have been lining up to fill up at gas stations, with occasional fistfights and shootings amid frayed nerves. More than half the population has been plunged into poverty, and with sectarian tensions on the rise, Lebanon feels ready to erupt. Lebanon’s currency crash has created a jarring schism between the comfortable minority whose income is in so-called fresh dollars that can be withdrawn from banks, and those being pushed farther into poverty, including former members of a vanishing middle class whose purchasing power has disappeared. Resorts in the coastal cities of Batroun and Byblos are regularly packed and forecast to do well this summer after being closed last year because of the pandemic. Restaurants, pubs and rooftop bars are buzzing again and some mountain guesthouses and boutique hotels are fully booked. Yet the idea that expats will help the economy is partially misleading, said Mike Azar, a Beirut-based financial adviser. “Foreign dollars coming from tourists is always going to be a positive thing, but does it make the lira (pound) appreciate or depreciate at a slower pace? It is not really something you can say.” Many expats seem to be wavering on whether to visit Lebanon. Some yearn to reconnect with family after long separations caused by the pandemic. Others are not willing to risk it. Joe Rizk, a 20-year-old mechanical engineering student at UMass Lowell in the U.S. from the coastal village of Damour, said his family persuaded him to return for the month of August. He said he would bring medicines that are in short supply, like Advil, for family and friends. ""I will not spend more than $300 or $400 this whole month even if I was going every night to a bar, or club or restaurant,” he said, adding he would be using the family house and car while in Lebanon. But Hala al-Hachem, a 37-year-old assistant bank manager in Massachusetts, said she was too worried to visit Lebanon with two children, aged 8 and 6. Originally from south Lebanon, she used to return with her family every summer. Not this time. “Do I want to go there and not be able to put gas in my car and travel around? Do I want to go there and risk one of them getting sick and going to a hospital where they don’t have the medicine needed to treat them? Do I want my sons to wonder at night why there is no electricity?” she asked."

Delta Air Lines Inc.’s Ed Bastian has mounted a media blitz at a pace of more than two interviews a week this year. Scott Kirby has been trying to burnish United Airlines Holdings Inc.’s corporate-citizenship clout by talking up its diversity goals and climate-change response. And at Southwest Airlines Co., Gary Kelly has ventured onto such non-financial venues as CBS’s Face the Nation and Axios on HBO. What started out last year as a public plea for government aid has morphed into a regular part of the job. CEOs are using their higher profile in the public arena to coax travelers back and call for less stringent global travel restrictions. Those efforts are apt to continue until the industry makes a fuller recovery -- a process that could take until next year at the earliest and may stretch into 2024, according to industry lobbying group Airlines for America. “Until the industry is really back, there is going to be this thirst for the most real-time information we can get” directly from CEOs, said Ben Baldanza, a JetBlue Airways Corp. board member and former chief executive officer of Spirit Airlines Inc. The tone of CEO communications is getting brighter, at least. Gone are the days when airline bosses used grim employee memos and securities filings to outline survival measures such as parking planes and cutting routes. Now, leisure passengers are crowding onto flights -- so much so, in fact, that American Airlines Group Inc. recently canceled hundreds of July flights because of crew shortages. Uncertainty over the return of corporate business trips and international flying means the financial recovery “will remain fragile and vulnerable to shocks,” said Airlines for America, which represents big carriers. Travel restrictions still crimp many lucrative overseas routes. And the airlines will be repaying liabilities for years after tapping debt markets to complement $54 billion in payroll assistance from U.S. taxpayers.The upshot is that CEOs are far from ready to retreat from the airwaves to back behind their desks. At Delta, Bastian has led the charge with 60 media interviews in 2020 and 70 so far this year, compared with about 20 in 2019. CNBC’s Jim Cramer recently quipped that Bastian would “walk a mile for a camera. But I love Ed.” One motivation has been that the fast-changing obstacles confronting the industry mean that executives constantly have something new to discuss, whether it’s aircraft-cleaning initiatives or pleas for better behavior on planes that are suddenly jam packed. They’re also under pressure to show they’ve made good use of the bailout funds.“The content itself was evolving so quickly and so dramatically it wasn’t as if we were saying the same thing three hours into this, or three weeks or three months,” said Tim Mapes, Delta’s chief marketing and communications officer. At Southwest, Kelly has recorded more than 70 internal videos since the start of the pandemic, starting with two a week, in which he answered questions from employees. Some were shared publicly on the airline’s website. Others were posted to social media such as Twitter and LinkedIn -- venues favored by other executives as well. Kelly has announced plans to step down next year and it remains to be seen if his chosen successor, company insider Bob Jordan, will dial up or pare back his media exposure. “It’s both effective and prudent for an airline to give these multiple layers of reassurance to the consumers, the investors, the suppliers, the partners,” said Geoffrey Weston, head of consultant Bain & Co.’s global airlines, logistics and transportation team. At American, CEO Doug Parker has been the exception with a somewhat quieter approach -- at least outwardly. Behind the scenes, he said, he’s never been more engaged in communicating. But he argues that the public is better served when experts address topics involving science or medical issues.“We’re doing it in the channels that make sense for American and feel really good about our message getting to the right people at the right time,” he said in an interview.Many airline CEOs joined leaders from other industries in commenting on broader issues such as race relations, the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, and the violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. But their main focus has been on extracting themselves from the travel collapse -- and planning for a post-pandemic future.At Delta, Bastian is hosting a series of video discussions on such matters as mental health and a philosophy called servant leadership -- and also appearing in pre-flight announcements touting the airline’s on-board Covid-19 mitigation efforts. United’s Kirby has been championing carbon-neutral aircraft and seeking to map out a long-term comeback.“Every virtual and in-person event has been purposeful to make sure our customers and employees know that United’s future is strong,” he said."

The hype has helped fuel a wave of funding into startups building the infrastructure to bring the new space race from science fiction to reality. Space-related technology is a $200 billion market that spans companies building products and services to use on Earth, in orbit or for space exploration and colonization missions. Venture capital investment in such companies reached a record $5.5 billion in 2020, according to market research firm PitchBook. The industry is on pace to top that milestone with $3.6 billion raised across 94 deals in the first six months of this year. The majority of capital has historically been funneled to companies focused on technology to use on Earth, including satellite communications and imagery, Earth monitoring and geospatial analytics. However, increasing ambitions to explore past our home planet are fueling what’s expected to be a vibrant “space-for-space economy,” Pitchbook analyst Ryan Vaswani wrote in a recent report. The new interest could benefit companies like LeoLabs, which has radar sites in Alaska, Texas, New Zealand and Costa Rica that track objects in orbit from satellites to tiny debris, helping to prevent collisions. The startup raised $65 million in funding in June led by Insight Partners and Velvet Sea Ventures. These advancements are just the beginning, according to Vaswani, citing the possibility of commercial space stations, space debris removal services and in-space manufacturing emerging by 2035 as launch costs become cheaper. Last week Branson completed a suborbital test flight aboard Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc.’s VSS Unity and Bezos is making his own journey to space on Tuesday, on a rocket made by his company Blue Origin. Marketing stunt or not, the increased attention around the industry has helped spur innovation and a surge of capital for companies looking to lay the foundation for space infrastructure. “The rising tide lifts all boats,” said Daniel Ceperley, co-founder and CEO of LeoLabs, a company that provides radar tracking services for objects in low Earth orbit."

Sarah Breeden, the central bank’s executive sponsor for climate change, said that policy makers could be encouraged to swap overseas trips for virtual meetings even when pandemic restrictions ease. The U.K. central bank hit its climate target nine years early after travel bans grounded most airplanes. “Going back to 2019 levels of travel shouldn’t be necessary, but the answer is not zero either,” Breeden said in an interview with the Press Association. “Our target is to reach net-zero by 2050 at the latest, but we’re seeing if we can do more.” In March, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak asked the BOE to include green targets in its deliberations. It started a major new stress test of the U.K.’s biggest banks and insurers last month to judge how resilient they are to climate change, a significant milestone ahead of Britain hosting the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow later this year. The bank also signaled in May that it will take account of the government’s environmental goals in buying assets in financial markets. That will affect any future purchases and reinvestments under its 20 billion pound ($28 billion) Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme, one of the emergency measures put in place to stimulate the economy during the coronavirus crisis."

Passenger traffic may improve by only 13% compared with last year in a worst-case scenario, the International Air Transport Association said Wednesday. That compares with an official forecast of a 50% rebound issued in December. Tough curbs on cross-border trips in response to new Covid-19 flareups could stifle a recovery despite strong pent-up demand, IATA Chief Economist Brian Pearce said in a media briefing. Herd immunity may be required before restrictions are eased, something that could be delayed by the identification of new viral strains. “There’s a recovery, but it’s a much smaller recovery,” Pearce said. “What we’ve seen in recent weeks is governments taking a much, much tougher, more cautious approach.” Passenger traffic fell by almost two thirds last year compared with 2019, IATA said. While the steepest drops came in April, the re-imposition of lockdowns meant the December figure was 70% lower, extending to 85% on international routes. Cargo demand fared much better, sliding only 11%. Should the lower estimate for a 13% improvement come to pass, that would equate to 38% of the level seen before the pandemic, IATA said. As a result, IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said carriers may require as much as $80 billion more in government funding to survive the year."

Fewer flight credits are on the verge of lapsing after United Airlines Holdings Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. recently extended expiration dates into 2022, following similar moves earlier in the crisis by rivals. About 11% of all open, unused tickets are now set to expire this year, down from 55% as of Jan. 29, according to TripActions, a corporate travel management firm. “It’s pretty clear that the shift is a reflection of the fact that airlines are adjusting dates to accommodate customers, both business and leisure, in this fluid travel environment,” said Kelly Soderlund, a spokeswoman for TripActions. The changing rules reflect the uncertain recovery of air travel after last year’s unprecedented collapse caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Most credits have traditionally expired 12 months after a ticket is purchased, and carriers extended expiration deadlines last year as air travel plunged. But many were set to expire this year -- and some already have -- as millions of would-be flyers continue to stay off planes. As more deadlines get extended, flight-credit expirations in 2022 have increased to 89% from 45% before, Soderlund said. The numbers represent unused U.S. airline ticket credits in TripActions’ database, but are largely reflective of the industry as a whole, she said. The collapse in demand and vanishing travel bookings that began in March 2020 forced airlines to issue billions in travel credits and vouchers for future trips, with about $11.7 billion remaining on the books of the six largest U.S. carriers at the end of last year. About $10.3 billion of that total is with the four biggest, American, United, Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. About 8% of new bookings are made with flight credits now, TripActions said, compared with 1% to 2% historically. Southwest said that 18% of non-loyalty ticket sales involved credits in the final quarter of 2020. There’s a “good chance” that carriers will extend expiration dates again if the recent uptick in domestic flight demand wanes, said Brett Snyder, president of Cranky Concierge, a travel planning firm. Airlines also could start to distinguish between expiration dates for domestic and international credits given the broader uncertainty of travel outside the U.S. “This summer is very up in the air right now,” said Snyder, who is also founder of the Crankyflier.com blog. “We don’t know where you’ll be able to go, what countries will let us in. What I think ultimately will be the fair thing to do will be to extend it another six months. Then you’ll have next summer to be able to go somewhere. Give people the ability to actually use them.” That’s cold comfort for customers whose credits have already expired. And the airlines don’t always make it easy. American has extended some vouchers, which differ from flight credits, through March 2022. But customers must contact the company to be assured of the extra time if the expiration date fell between March 1, 2020, and Dec. 31, 2020. While domestic passenger levels are the highest they have been since the pandemic started, traveler volumes are still down 44% compared to the comparable period in 2019, according to Airlines for America, a trade group. International passengers are down 63%. With the deep slump dragging on, carriers have taken actions including the following: The looser rules only go so far. At Southwest, a trip booked Sept. 8 of last year or later reverted to the normal 12-month use period, and American reinstated its normal one-year expiration period beginning Oct. 1, 2020. The same will be true at United starting April 1. “Based on the increasing availability of vaccines and the fact that we’re seeing more leisure travel booked every day, we are confident that by next spring, anyone who wants and is able to travel will be able to do so,” said Andrea Koos, a spokeswoman for American. Late last year, Delta Air Lines Inc. extended travel credits through December 31, 2022. But that applies to tickets booked prior to April 17, 2020, for travel scheduled on or after March 1, 2020. So anyone who booked a ticket April 18 or soon after has an approaching expiration date. Delta is evaluating the policy, a spokesman said. Southwest extended expiration dates early in the pandemic through Sept. 7, 2022 for those who booked travel or had credits that would have expired between March 1 and Sept. 7, 2020. Customers also can convert them to loyalty program points, which never expire. At Alaska Air Group Inc., credits issued after March 1, 2020, that would have expired before July 5 of this year can be used through the end of 2022 to book trips -- and the actual travel dates can be as late as Nov. 30, 2023. JetBlue Airways Corp. provided a 24-month expiration period for credits issued in March through June of 2020, meaning they must be used between those months in 2022. United said in February that flight credit for tickets purchased between May 1, 2019, and March 31, 2021, will be extended through March 31, 2022. American last week extended the expiration date for flight credits to March 31, 2022, from the previous deadline of Dec. 31, 2021. The extra time applies to tickets purchased by Sept. 30, 2020, and for travel between March 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021."

Chief executive officer Arnold Donald questions the fairness of restricting cruises while allowing other travel modes with less-stringent health protocols. Donald has been CEO of Carnival, the world’s largest cruise company, with nine lines, since 2013. Carnival’s eponymous U.S.-based unit said on April 6 it may consider moving its ships from U.S. home ports. The U.S. later said it might allow restricted cruising by midsummer.  Was mentioning possibly leaving U.S. ports a threat to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention?No, there was no threat. It’s just a practical reality that if we’re  not able to sail from the U.S. in some months soon, we would have to sail from elsewhere.  So what’s next with U.S. officials?We’re hopeful we’ll be able to meet with the administration and the CDC and come up with something that’s practical and will allow people to return to their choice of vacation travel—and get a lot of Americans back to work. Over a half-million people are impacted in the U.S. in jobs associated with the cruise industry, outside of the cruise lines themselves.  Are cruise lines being treated unfairly?Today you can board a plane, fly to a country, get on a cruise ship and sail, fly back from that country, and come back to the U.S. You’d have to do certain testing, but you can do that. Yet, even if vaccinated, you can’t get on a cruise ship in the U.S. If you look at arenas where people are able to attend sporting events, restaurants, hotels, resorts, air travel, there’s a level of risk management and mitigation. So we would like to just be treated similarly to the  rest of the travel and tourism sector.  Are travelers ready to resume cruising?When we announced three brands with sailings in July in the U.K., Princess had its second-highest-ever single-day bookings. P&O had its highest in seven years, and Cunard its highest in a decade. There’s plenty of pent-up demand.  Will you require passengers to be vaccinated, like Norwegian Cruise Line just announced it will?No, absolutely. We would encourage everyone to get vaccinated, but today vaccines are not accessible to everyone. In some places it is illegal to mandate. And we respect personal choice and personal liberty. So we’ll follow what the regulations are wherever it is.  Even when the rules about vaccinations may go harder against your industry?We stand to do the thing that’s in the best interest of public health. However, if vaccines are not mandated for other forms of travel and tourism, then we’re not sure that it makes sense to mandate them for cruises either. We think fair and level treatment, serving the best interest of public health, is what we should be about.  What do you say to those who argue that other forms of travel, like flying, are safer?Some people say, “Well, you’re only on a plane for a few hours.” But you are sitting right next to someone. Before you got on the plane, you were in an airport terminal. Before you were in the terminal, you were in some kind of transportation. Before that, you came from somewhere. When you land, you go to another airport terminal. And then you get in an automobile, or a bus, or whatever you need to get on for transport. And then you might go to a restaurant, stay in a hotel, go to a resort. A cruise is a city at sea. So to compare us just to an airplane ride is inappropriate. And to compare us just to a hotel stay is inappropriate. Look at the evidence: Over 400,000 people have sailed in Europe [since the pandemic began] with fewer than 50 cases of Covid, all handled seamlessly without disruption. And that all happened before vaccines.  How will the rapid expansion of vaccines change things?Now we have the vaccines, which are another layer, and a major layer. We would encourage everyone to get vaccinated, because it is one of the best levels of protection against any serious effects from Covid that you can have. And that’s what the science says. But we will respect whatever the rules are wherever we go, as we always do. We have to be in compliance."

The unions said Breeze, an upstart domestic carrier founded by airline entrepreneur David Neeleman, violated age discrimination and diversity statutes with a plan to hire flight attendants solely through a tuition reimbursement, work-study program with Utah Valley University. The strategy pulls from a primarily young, White applicant pool, the petitioners say, citing enrollment figures at the Orem, Utah, university, and favors inexperienced workers as a measure of cost savings. “For a profession that had an established reputation for discriminating against older workers throughout history and that has only recently begun to combat these ingrained, ageist behaviors, Breeze’s recruitment strategy is more in line with historical standards rather than modern ones,” the complaint states. Some 78% of UVU’s students are White, according to figures from 2018. Among those making the complaint to the U.S. Department of Transportation were the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, the Transportation Trades Department and the Transport Workers Union of America.Breeze, which began flying May 27 with an initial network of 16 cities, dropped its original plan to rely exclusively on students as young as 18 as flight attendants because it didn’t produce enough job applicants, but said at the time it would continue the program with UVU in combination with posting openings more broadly online. The airline is a unit of closely held Breeze Aviation Group Inc., which is based in Cottonwood Heights, Utah, near Salt Lake City.Neeleman, who created JetBlue Airways Corp., Brazil’s Azul SA and other carriers, has built his career by devising new low-cost strategies."

Almost 100 flights from the airline have already been canceled for June 21, according to a representative from American Airlines Group Inc. That’s following 123 flights canceled on Saturday and at least 178 on Sunday. “The first few weeks of June have brought unprecedented weather to our largest hubs, heavily impacting our operation and causing delays, canceled flights and disruptions to crew member schedules and our customers’ plans,” American Airlines said in a statement. Combined with labor shortages and increased bookings, that’s caused the airline to adjust some of its flights through mid-July, the company said. Airlines have struggled to deal with the spike in demand for air travel as people across the globe get vaccinated and embark on trips once again. Earlier this month, the number of daily U.S. air travelers rose above 2 million for the first time since the pandemic started, according to the Transportation Security Administration. Industrywide, a total of 272 flights within, into, or out of the U.S. were canceled on Saturday and 5,560 were delayed, according to data from FlightAware.com.

A White House official said that half of American adults will be fully vaccinated as of Tuesday. The impact of inoculations is causing a reversal of fortunes in Bloomberg’s Covid Resilience Ranking, with last month’s leader -- Singapore -- falling along with other Asian economies that had been lauded for thwarting the virus. WATCH: Johns Hopkins says it’s hard to see Covid spiraling out of control in the U.S. Source: Bloomberg The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that as of April 30 there were 10,262 cases of vaccinated people who were later infected with Covid-19 out of approximately 101 million people who are fully inoculated. A small number of so-called breakthrough infections after full vaccination are to be expected because no vaccines are 100% effective. The CDC notes the reported cases are likely a substantial undercount since many people, especially those who are asymptomatic or have only mild illness, might not seek testing. In May, health officials shifted to investigating only cases in which patients were hospitalized or died, drawing concern from some scientists who say that may mean missing needed data. The British government warned people to avoid traveling to hot spots in England where the variant first identified in India is spreading, as officials in France consider further curbs on passengers arriving from the U.K. The guidance applies to eight areas including Hounslow in west London, the central England city of Leicester and the northwest towns of Blackburn and Bolton. People there should not meet up indoors or travel outside their districts, the government said. Ireland is set to announce this week that it will remove the requirement for travelers arriving from the U.K. to self quarantine for 14 days, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported, even amid increasing concern about the spread of the variant first identified in India. Authorities are watching the variant’s spread in the U.K. “very carefully,” Prime Minister Micheal Martin told reporters in Brussels. Irish officials declined to comment on the Telegraph report. Moderna Inc.’s vaccine was highly effective in 12- to 17-year-olds in a large study, paving the way for regulatory submissions around the world by early June. In a news release, the company said its vaccine was between 93% and 100% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid in teenagers, depending on whether very mild cases are included in the count. The study met its primary goal of showing that immune responses to the vaccine were as good as those produced in adults, and no significant safety concerns were observed, according to the company. Some factories in Vietnam’s virus-hit northern province of Bac Giang, where suppliers for Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. operate, will be allowed to reopen as early as May 28, according to a statement from the provincial government. Plants that meet required anti-virus procedures will be given permission to restart operations. Excessive use of the world’s most potent antibiotics has stoked drug-resistant infections in India for years. Now the country’s Covid crisis has put the calamity into hyperdrive. A first look at the number of patients hospitalized during India’s first coronavirus wave who also developed bacterial and fungal infections found that a small but alarming proportion harbor germs that resist multiple drugs. Doctors battling to save lives amid a dearth of effective treatments are turning to the drugs they have on hand -- and a lot of those are antibiotics that other countries wouldn’t use for Covid-19. What’s more, the chaos of overrun hospitals means staff can’t always take precautions to ensure infections don’t spread from one patient to the next. France will probably decide on Wednesday whether additional restrictions are needed at its border with the U.K. to fend off a variant first identified in India. The U.K. is trying to make a case to France that extra curbs aren’t necessary, citing the large share of its vaccinated population, a person familiar with the discussions said. About 70% of adults in Britain have received at least one vaccine dose, and 40% both doses, but a new and potentially more contagious strain is spreading fast. The impact of vaccination is causing a reversal of fortunes in Bloomberg’s Covid Resilience Ranking, a monthly snapshot of the best and worst places to be in the coronavirus era. Last month’s No. 1 -- Singapore -- fell in May along with other Asian economies. Taiwan and Japan dropped out of the top 10 amid sluggish inoculation drives and resurgent cases, while some of the world’s fiercest outbreaks held down places in Southeast and South Asia. New Zealand regained the top position, but its vaccine rollout has barely started, leaving it potentially vulnerable. In contrast, U.S. and parts of Europe have been steadily climbing up the ranking as outbreaks slowly wane. With vaccine protection growing, they’re restarting travel, scrapping mask mandates and looking to leave Covid-19 behind: The U.K. jumped 7 spots to 11th and the U.S. is No. 13. France, the Czech Republic and Poland saw double-digit increases in their positions. France is weighing whether to impose additional restrictions at its border with Britain to fend off the variant first identified in India. The British government warned people to avoid traveling to hot spots in England where the variant is spreading.

The rebound in U.S. travel is gaining steam, according to the country’s three biggest airlines. The pace of the recovery has been faster than expected, Delta Air Lines Inc. President Glen Hauenstein said Tuesday.  United Airlines Holdings Inc. predicted it would turn a profit before certain items next quarter, while American Airlines Group Inc. said corporate trips and long overseas flights -- the worst-hit segments during the pandemic -- are poised for improvement. Public approval of Uruguay President Luis Lacalle Pou’s handling of the pandemic fell to 62% in May from 72% in February, pollster Opcion Consultores found. Disapproval of Lacalle Pou’s handling of the pandemic rose to 15% from 10%. Opcion interviewed 824 people via mobile phone May 13-20 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%. Uruguay led the world in Covid-19 deaths per capita in the last week even with one of Latin America’s most successful vaccination programs. Harvard students will return to the classroom full time for the fall semester and campus housing will go back to its usual density after more than a year of remote learning. The university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is expecting the largest entering class in its history, Harvard said Tuesday in a statement on its website. All enrolled students, who must be vaccinated to attend, can expect full campus access, which includes libraries, archives, museums and research facilities. Hong Kong may donate Covid-19 vaccines to countries more in need of them via channels such as the World Health Organization’s Covax initiative as local demand for Pfizer-BioNTech shots “has gradually become sluggish recently,” according to a government statement late Tuesday. Of the approximately 2 million BioNTech doses which have been delivered to Hong Kong, the city has 840,000 unused doses in storage that will expire in mid-August; it has procured 7.5 million doses in total. As Russia struggles to get its population to take the coronavirus vaccines heralded by President Vladimir Putin, the far east region of Yakutia is passing the strictest inoculation requirements yet. All companies, both public-sector and private, are required to organize shots for their workers, according to a decree by the region’s chief medical authority. Employers that fail to do so may face fines, Yakutia President Aisen Nikolaev’s press service said separately. The target is to cover at least 70% of all adults by July. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city will bring mobile vaccination units to beaches and parks starting during the Memorial Day weekend and lasting through the summer, including the Rockaways, Coney Island, Central Park and Governors Island. De Blasio said that starting Tuesday there will be a vaccination site in front of Madison Square Garden, which will be offering people getting the shot a chance to win tickets to the next New York Knicks playoff game.

In last week’s issue, I  wrote about President Donald Trump’s puzzling reluctance to push a big stimulus package that would jolt the economy just before voters head to the polls in November to decide his fate. Instead, the president has mostly stood by as coronavirus relief measures run out and Congress stalemates on further aid to businesses and workers. One cost of this inaction will soon become clear: If the government’s payroll support program for airlines is allowed to expire as scheduled on Wednesday, the airlines say they’ll cut tens of thousands of jobs—many concentrated in battleground states including North Carolina, Florida, Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Texas. The danger of mass job loss in the airline industry has been apparent since the virus first emerged. Few people are eager to travel in enclosed steel tubes and risk becoming sick, or worse, so U.S. air travel has plummeted. A $25 billion relief package under the CARES Act mitigated the employment effects by forbidding airlines from involuntarily furloughing workers before Oct. 1. For months, airlines and workers’ unions have been imploring Congress and the president to extend that payroll aid, without any success. With air travel not expected to return to pre-Covid levels for at least three more years,  according to a Moody’s report, airlines are preparing to move ahead with mass job cuts once aid runs out. Because many airline hubs are located in swing states, those cuts will fall heavily on areas Trump needs to win. Airlines have made no secret of these impending cuts. U.S. labor law requires employers with more than 100 workers to give 60 days’ notice before cutting more than 50 employees. Over the summer, airlines including American, United, Spirit, and Delta filed notices under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act that they are planning to lay off tens of thousands of workers beginning Oct. 1. Together, those airlines operate hubs in Phoenix, Philadelphia, Charlotte, Miami, and Houston. A review of WARN notices filed in battleground states finds that many of the job cuts will fall on precisely these areas. Absent a last-minute extension of federal aid—Democrats in the House of Representatives introduced one Monday night, though its prospects are murky—American’s  plan to cut 19,000 jobs will hit Arizona, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Spirit will cut about 1,000 jobs in Florida. United expects to furlough around 12,000 workers, even after reaching an agreement with its pilots’ union on Monday to  avoid almost 4,000 job cuts. In addition, WARN filings show that there will be thousands more layoffs in these states from smaller airlines, concessionaires, airport restaurants, and other ancillary services. The political fallout isn’t limited to the presidential race, either. Control of the Senate could also hang in the balance. Republican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, locked in an uphill battle for reelection, has led an effort among Senate Republicans to extend aid for airline jobs before it expires on Wednesday. Failure will make his race even tougher. Among other cuts that could hit Colorado as soon as Thursday, United warned in July that it plans nearly 3,000 “employment separations” at its Denver hub if payroll support isn’t renewed. It’s been clear for several weeks that absent a strong, public push from Trump, a new relief package with aid for airlines is unlikely to be forthcoming. The fight to replace late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the New York Times’ bombshell report on Trump’s tax avoidance, and the distraction of tonight’s presidential debate all make the odds of Congress reaching agreement on further stimulus even slimmer. A new round of avoidable airline layoffs will likely only add to the anti-incumbent mood that threatens Trump and vulnerable GOP senators. It’s clear the economic recovery is slowing down. Now, instead of a new stimulus check, tens of thousands of swing-state voters could be heading into Election Day with a pink slip."

Elsewhere in Europe, Germany is easing rules for travelers from Britain, Portugal and other nations. Meanwhile, the delta variant was boosting case numbers worldwide, with Indonesia and Bangladesh reporting record infections and Sydney considering whether to extend its lockdown. So-called long Covid is set to soar among younger people in England when remaining coronavirus restrictions are lifted, England’s chief medical officer warned. “Since there’s a lot of Covid at the moment and the rates are going up, I regret to say I think we will get a significant amount more long Covid -- particularly in the younger ages where the vaccination rates are currently much lower,” Chris Witty said at the Local Government Association’s virtual conference Tuesday. Long Covid occurs when a wide range of health problems keep happening weeks or months after patients seemingly recover from even a mild case. On Monday, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced plans Monday to end social distancing and capacity limits at venues in England from July 19, with a final decision to be taken next week. Health Minister Sajid Javid, meanwhile, warned that new cases could rise to 100,000 a day over the summer. Greece plans to re-tighten pandemic measures on bars and clubs after 1,797 new cases were recorded Tuesday, the highest daily increase since June 1. The spike in cases was associated with younger adults attending large night-time entertainment venues, Deputy Citizen Protection Minister Nikos Hardalias said on Tuesday. From July 8, such venues will revert to seated spaces only with capacity limitations, according to Hardalias. The benefits of messenger RNA Covid-19 vaccines clearly outweigh the risks despite heart complications seen in a relatively small number of mostly young men, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Roughly 1,200 cases of myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart wall, were reported in people who received mRNA vaccines, the CDC said in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on Tuesday. But with about 296 million doses of mRNA vaccines having been administered as of June 11, the benefit is clear in all populations, including adolescents and young adults, the researchers reported. Vaccines made by Moderna Inc. and the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE partnership are the only mRNA inoculations authorized for emergency use in the U.S. The issue was first explored in a June 23 meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Weekly coronavirus cases in the Netherlands more than doubled from the prior week. The national health service reported 8,541 infections on Tuesday, a signficant rise from the 4,208 cases reported on June 29. At least 180 people contracted Covid-19 after visiting the Aspen Valley nightclub in Enschede on June 26, reports the Dutch news agency ANP, citing the local health service. Health minister Hugo de Jonge has asked that people only visit a nightclub two weeks after they have been fully vaccinated, adding that this adjustment to the rules will take effect “in the short term.” The African Union and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have advised health ministers on the continent that they have 15 million Covid-19 vaccines donated by the U.S. ready for distribution. The shipment, to be distributed by the vaccine-sharing initiative Covax, consists of 5 million Johnson & Johnson doses, administered in a single shot, and 10 million doses of the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine, given in two shots. The advisory, seen by Bloomberg, came in a July 5 communication from the two groups to member states. The allocation to each country will be communicated by the end of next week, according to the advisory. Bangladesh on Tuesday reported a record 11,525 virus cases, raising the overall tally to 966,406 as the delta variant spreads in both urban and rural areas despite a stringent lockdown. The South Asian nation logged 163 new deaths from the disease. The government has redeployed doctors to the Covid-19 units of hospitals in remote districts, according to Health Minister Zahid Maleque. Bangladesh extended its lockdown measures by a week to July 14. “Urgent action” is needed to increase vaccine supplies for Bangladesh as “hospitals reach capacity and oxygen supplies run short across the country,” the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in an emailed statement. From Aug. 16, “anyone who is a close contact of a positive case will no longer have to self-isolate if they have been fully vaccinated,” U.K. government Health Secretary Sajid Javid said in Parliament. School-aged children under age 18 will also no longer have to automatically isolate if exposed to the virus. Javid warned on Tuesday that new cases could rise to 100,000 a day over the summer as the country prepares to relax rules on July 19. “By the time we get to the 19th, we would expect case numbers by then to be at least double what they are now, so around 50,000 new cases a day,” Javid said on the BBC Radio “Today Programme.” “As we ease and go into the summer, we expect them to rise significantly and they could go as high as 100,000 case numbers.” What matters most is that the link with hospitalization and death “has been severely weakened,” he said. As Vietnam battles a resurgence of Covid-19, the nation is going to extraordinary lengths to protect its reputation as a vital cog in the global tech supply chain — with thousands of workers sleeping on factory floors to minimize disruption. In the northern provinces of Bac Ninh and Bac Giang, a key manufacturing hub that’s home to Samsung Electronics Co. and leading Apple Inc. suppliers, authorities say about 150,000 workers are living at industrial parks to reduce the risk of infections. In the commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City, 22 companies with a workforce of 25,000 also set up sleepover sites for an unspecified number of employees. Germany should aim to fully vaccinate at least 85% of people ages 12 to 59 by the end of this summer and 90% of those 60 and older to prevent a fourth wave that could fill up intensive care units again, according to a government report. The country also needs to continue using basic hygiene measures like face masks and maintain some social distancing, the modeling report from the Robert Koch Institute public health agency said. To achieve those vaccination levels, shipments of shots must arrive on time and people can’t put off getting inoculated during vacation season, the report said. The modeling takes into account the higher transmissibility of the delta variant. Indonesia has reported record infections and fatalities for three straight days as hospitals become overwhelmed and local oxygen supply struggles to keep up with surging demand. There were 31,189 confirmed cases in the 24 hours through midday Tuesday, with 728 deaths. Russia’s coronavirus task force reported a record of 737 Covid-19 deaths on Tuesday as the country struggles against a surge from the delta variant. As was the case in previous months, death statistics are likely to be revised upward by Russia’s Federal Statistics Service when it releases monthly figures. England will select a new cricket squad for its One Day International matches against Pakistan -- scheduled for Thursday in Cardiff -- after three players and four staff members tested positive, the BBC reported. Some 501 new cases were confirmed in Israel on Monday, the highest number for a single day since March, according to Health Ministry data. At the same time, the number of serious cases dipped to 33 from 35. About 42% of the newly diagnosed had been fully vaccinated. The efficacy of Pfizer-BioNTech SE’s vaccine has declined in the past month, though it continues to shield well against severe illness, the ministry said on Monday. London’s West End shopping area is almost as busy as it was before the pandemic, while the financial districts remain only half full. That suggests more residents are comfortable traveling into crowded centers, but are in no rush to return to the office. Last week’s transaction volume at Pret A Manger Ltd. sandwich stores in the West End was 78% of what it was before the pandemic, the highest level since lockdown measures began easing in March, according to Bloomberg’s Pret Index. A social distancing sign outside a book stall in Guildhall Market in Bath, U.K., on Monday, July 5, 2021. The U.K. is in a race to vaccinate the population against the fast-spreading delta variant quickly enough to be able to lift social-distancing curbs and reopen more businesses on July 19. South Korea signed a vaccine swap deal with Israel to receive about 700,000 doses of Pfizer’s shot, South Korea’s Disease Control & Prevention Agency said. As part of the deal, Israel will receive an identical number of Pfizer doses from Korea in September through November. Starting Wednesday, Germany wilo longer designate nations including the U.K. and Portugal as virus variant areas, lifting a requirement for all inbound travelers -- including those fully vaccinated -- to quarantine for 14 days. The RKI public-health institute updated its list of variant countries late Monday, also removing Russia, India and Nepal. Still on the list are nations including Brazil, South Africa and Uruguay. India recorded its lowest tally of confirmed cases in a day since March 17 when the delta-driven second wave started gripping the nation, overwhelming hospitals and crematoriums. The country added 34,703 cases Tuesday, taking the total to 30.6 million. It has administered 357.6 million vaccine shots so far as it races to avert subsequent waves. Covid-related casualties rose by 553 in a day to 403,281, according to latest data by the Indian Health Ministry. Hong Kong will assess Singapore’s new Covid-19 strategy as the two sides try to revive a quarantine-free travel corridor that was initially planned to open last November. “We need to understand more about that new strategy and whether it will have any impact on the arrangements that we have devised,” Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said at a briefing when asked about the so-called travel bubble. “The situation is very stable on both sides, so this is something that we will be working very closely on.” Singapore is set to loosen restrictions on activities such as dining out next week as its vaccination rate improves, and more opportunity for travel could open up further down the line. The country plans to have two-thirds of its population of almost 6 million fully vaccinated by Aug. 9. Several cities in the Philippine capital region halted their first-dose vaccination programs as supply from the national government runs out. Makati City, home to the nation’s main financial district, said the scheduled inoculation of frontline workers receiving the vaccine for the first time won’t push through on Tuesday. It also shut several vaccination sites in malls and schools, the city government said on Facebook. Paranaque, Caloocan and Valenzuela cities have also stopped first-dose vaccinations as they await for additional supplies, while Malabon and Muntinlupa announced they will no longer entertain walk-ins. Australia needs to vaccinate at least 85% of the population to achieve herd immunity, a James Cook University researcher said in a statement Monday. “Herd immunity has become more difficult to achieve with the delta variant, as it is both more infectious and less amenable to vaccination,” said Emma McBryde, professor of infectious diseases epidemiology and modelling. Even without herd immunity, “vaccinated people are protected against severe disease and much less likely to be hospitalized or die,” McBryde said. The strongest, most credible evidence indicate SARS-CoV-2 evolved in nature, and suggestions of a laboratory leak aren’t backed by scientific evidence, scientists wrote in a letter to the Lancet Monday. “Allegations and conjecture are of no help,” wrote the authors, who include Rita Colwell, Peter Daszak, Christian Drosten, Jeremy Farrar and Juan Lubroth. “It is time to turn down the heat of the rhetoric and turn up the light of scientific inquiry if we are to be better prepared to stem the next pandemic, whenever it comes and wherever it begins.” The Japanese government is planning to hold the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics without fans, giving up earlier plans to have spectators at the July 23 event, the Asahi newspaper reported, citing several unidentified government officials. IOC committee members, sponsors and other officials will be allowed to attend the ceremony, but the government will attempt to further downsize the number. Venues with capacity of 10,000 people or more will be banned from having spectators as well as games scheduled later than 9 p.m. The Australian Grand Prix Formula One race planned for November has been canceled, and Japan plans to hold the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics without fans, according to reports. Africa health ministers advised 15 million vaccine doses donated by the U.S. are ready for distribution. Anheuser-Busch InBev’s division in Botswana filed a lawsuit against the government for banning alcohol sales to combat the spread of Covid-19, saying there’s no scientific basis for the move and 200,000 jobs are under threat. Kgalagadi Breweries Ltd. filed the claim in the High Court in Gaborone, according to a statement on Tuesday. The prohibition is having a devastating impact on the industry and its “extensive value chain,” spokesman Masegonyana Madisa said.

Sydney has been in lockdown since June 26, and faces being increasingly isolated from the rest of the nation with authorities indicating the curbs may need to be extended beyond Friday. The outbreak is highlighting the problems with Australia’s tardy vaccine roll-out, which has been hit by supply-chain hold-ups from contracted drug-makers. Political rivals also say that Prime Minister Scott Morrison failed to secure enough doses from a wide-enough range of suppliers. While Australia was an early success story in the fight against Covid-19, a sluggish vaccine rollout means even as the rest of the world opens up the country’s borders are expected to stay shut to most of the outside world until well into 2022. Just 26% of the population have received their first jab, according to Bloomberg’s Vaccine Tracker, compared with about 70% in Singapore. Hodgman, who also served as the premier of Tasmania state for six years until 2020, also said in the interview that Australia viewed the Quad security partnership as having a “complementary” relationship with Asean. Australia’s Morrison has increasingly encouraged the Quad, which includes key ally the U.S. as well as Japan and India, to act as a counter against what it sees as China’s assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific. Australian exporters are increasingly concerned that Morrison’s government is making public statements that seem to be stoking tensions with Beijing, which has launched a volley of punitive trade actions that have hit commodities from coal to barley to lobsters and wine. “It’s literally our region, so it’s important that Australia continues to have Southeast Asia at the center of our foreign policy which we do,” Hodgman said. “The Quad is an arrangement of like-minded countries similarly inclined to ensure that trade is open and free, that international rules based orders are adhered to, and that our broader region remains stable and secure.”"

The European Union’s air-safety regulator told airlines to avoid flying over Belarus, saying the diversion of a Ryanair Holdings Plc flight on Sunday raised doubts about the Eastern European nation’s respect for international aviation rules. The safety bulletin issued by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency unifies the region after several of its member states and the U.K. issued similar guidelines. While the advisories aren’t binding, airlines tend to follow them. Carriers started to avoid Belarus earlier this week, in response to the re-routing of a Ryanair flight to Minsk, where authorities detained a dissident journalist. Governments from Europe to the U.S. have rejected the contention of Belarusian officials that the detour was necessary because of a bomb threat.  Britain took the further step of banning Belarusian airlines including state carrier Belavia from British airspace. EASA said the May 23 incident “amounted to an increased safety risk” for the flight and “put into question the ability of Belarus to provide safe air navigation services.” The country’s actions raise “serious doubts on the respect shown by Belarus for international civil aviation rules.” Operations in airspace controlled by Minsk, the Belarusian capital, should be avoided unless deemed necessary to ensure safe operation in case of unforeseen circumstances, EASA said."

The airline industry pushed back its hopes of a rebound in traffic levels to pre-pandemic levels amid disappointing passenger numbers since lockdowns lifted. A full recovery is unlikely before 2024, a year later than it recently predicted, the International Air Transport Association said on a call Tuesday. Traffic is not growing as fast as airlines are adding capacity, the industry’s main trade group added. “The demand and the revenues are not rising as quickly as expected so airlines are still burning cash,” IATA chief economist Brian Pearce said. “The situation is deterioriating relative to what we had expected.” Airlines have been battered by the restrictions brought in to contain the coronavirus. Carriers had been pinning their hopes on catching the tail-end of the profitable summer season but disruptions continue amid viral flare-ups in countries like France and Spain. The restart of travel could be the most difficult time for airlines as they begin to incur higher costs when there are insufficient passenger numbers to generate profit. The majority of airlines likely won’t return to positive cash flow until 2021, Pearce said. Business travel is not yet recovering in line with a rebound in industry confidence, said Pearce, suggesting that behaviors have changed. There will likely be less corporate travel to company offices in the future, he said, with consequences for business models which often depend on high-paying executive fliers to cover the shortfall on economy tickets. Although the level of traffic showed an improvement in June from prior months, it was still 86.5% down from a year earlier. The leisure travel market is not likely to recover until consumer confidence is restored, according to the airline lobby group. The U.K.’s decision to reintroduce quarantine for passengers returning from Spain is “very significant,” said Pearce. A renewed increase in cases has been seen in countries including Hong Kong, Germany and Spain. IATA chief Alexandre de Juniac said he favors virus tests as a means of easing restrictions."

He claims he spent $100,000 of his own money to develop his QrewLive app, which he pitched to the airline as a way to address crew communication snafus after disrupted flights. Delta turned him down but went on to launch its own identical tool, he claims. Delta “stole like a thief in the night” and defrauded its own loyal employee, Keenan Nix, a lawyer for Alexander, said Wednesday in an interview. He said Alexander, an 11-year veteran at the airline, was flying a Delta 757 “as we speak.” Morgan Durrant, a Delta spokesperson, said in a statement: “While we take the allegations specified in Mr. Alexander’s complaint seriously, they are not an accurate or fair description of Delta’s development of its internal crew messaging platform.” A five-hour power outage that resulted in hundreds of flight cancellations in August 2016 cost Delta more than $150 million. The pilot said in the suit he emailed Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian at the time saying “he had a ‘solution.’” Bastian allegedly responded promptly and referred Alexander to the company’s new chief information officer. Bastian and the CIO, Rahul Samant, are both named in the suit, along with four other Delta executives. Alexander claims he had several positive meetings with the airline in 2015 and 2016 in which executives made clear they were interested in acquiring his app. But Delta eventually cut off discussions and then launched its own crew app in April 2018, called Flight Family Communications. “‘FFC’ is a carbon copy, knock-off of the role-based text messaging component of Craig’s proprietary QrewLive communications platform,” Alexander said in his suit. The pilot noted in his suit that Bastian and Samant have both bragged to investors that the app has smoothed operations. In describing the damages he’s seeking, Alexander said the value of the technology, “based solely upon operational cost savings to Delta, conservatively exceeds $1 billion.” Alexander is also seeking punitive damages against Delta. “To add insult to theft and injury, Captain Craig Alexander must use his stolen QrewLive text messaging platform every day while he works for Delta,” the suit claims. “Each time he looks at the FFC app, he is painfully reminded that Delta stole his proprietary trade secrets, used them to Delta’s enormous financial benefit.” The pilot could face a challenge pursuing his claims as a Delta employee, as companies typically own the rights to anything produced by their workers. In his suit Alexander stressed that he put his own time and resources into QrewLive and said Delta indicated it would be willing to purchase the app from him on the same terms as from an outside vendor. The case is Alexander v. Delta Air Lines Inc., 21A03275, Georgia State Court, DeKalb County."

Toronto’s housing market recorded its second consecutive month of slowing sales in May, as reduced supply and a lingering lockdown to contain the coronavirus helped to cool off the market. The number of homes that traded hands in Canada’s largest city fell 8.9% in May from the month before, according to data released Thursday from the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board. The seasonally-adjusted average selling price for a home in the Toronto region still rose 1.1% from April, to C$1,061,987 ($882,300). People wait in line to receive a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine at a clinic in Toronto earlier in May. Experimental drug Tempol “may be a promising oral antiviral treatment for Covid-19,” the National Institutes of Health said, citing findings from a study of cell cultures by its researchers. Tempol can limit Covid-19 infection by impairing the activity of a viral enzyme called RNA replicase, NIH said in a statement. The number of people hospitalized for Covid-19 in New York State fell to less than 1,000 for the first time since Oct. 21. While almost 58% of adult New Yorkers have completed their vaccinations, hospitalizations declined to 970 on Wednesday, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Twitter.

Early evidence suggests there “may be an increased risk of hospitalization” for Delta, although “more data is needed for us to have more confidence in that finding,” PHE said in an emailed statement.U.K. cases of the Delta variant more than doubled in the last week to 12,431. The U.K. removed Portugal from its so-called green list of countries that Britons can visit without having to quarantine after returning home. The setback for summer tourism sent airline shares lower. “It feels like the summer for U.K. airlines is fast ebbing away,” said Rob Morris, who heads consultancy at aviation tracker Ascend by Cirium. Tourists walk through a square past restaurants and cafes in Lagos, Portugal, on May 30. Separately, the European Union decided to maintain restrictions on non-essential travel from the U.S. and the U.K., meaning visitors from those countries may still need to abide by quarantine requirements. Fully vaccinated visitors to the EU won’t have to quarantine as of July 1. Inoculations against Covid-19 reached 2 billion on Thursday. It took just over six months to reach the milestone, an extraordinary accomplishment precipitated by countries’ desperation to save lives and reopen their economies. Still, it’ll take nine more months to vaccinate 75% of the global population, a threshold that could provide so-called herd immunity. The virus has stricken almost 172 million people and killed close to 3.7 million since the first cases emerged about 18 months ago. New York City is expanding its vaccination effort to the city’s party-goers, using a vaccine bus to meet younger New Yorkers outside restaurants, clubs and other nightlife hotspots in popular neighborhoods such as the East Village and Bushwick. The city also is starting mobile vaccination sites at schools on Friday. Some venues will offer a “shot for a shot,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said. More than 8 million shots have been delivered in the city, but the vaccine rate has dropped to about 26,000 a day from a high of more than 100,000 in April. A person wearing a protective masks exits a mobile Covid-19 vaccine clinic at Brighton Beach in the Brooklyn borough of New York on May 31. Only 37% of New Yorkers age 18 to 24 are fully vaccinated, compared to 71% of people age 65 to 74. Positive test results reached a record low of 0.81% as of June 1, on a seven-day average. U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said it was possible the world would never find out the precise origin of the coronavirus pandemic, after President Joe Biden last month ordered a new 90-day review from the intelligence community about the possible origins of the virus. Fauci said during an appearance on MSNBC that while he feels it is still “more likely” that the virus jumped from animals to humans, “we still don’t know what the origin is.” Fauci said that reports that three researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick in November 2019 gave more credence to the possibility that Covid-19 may have emerged from a “lab leak,” but said those reports still needed to be verified, while maintaining that animal to human transition happens “all the time.” “You need to keep looking for the link and you need to keep looking for evidence that it’s something else like a lab leak,” Fauci said. “Those are open possibilities. We may not ever find out what that is.” China can’t begin to ease restrictions like the U.S. even after inoculating a high level of its population because it has no way of analyzing how well its vaccines have worked in its largely Covid-free population, according to a top health official. Despite vaccinating more than 40% of its citizens with at least one dose, Feng Zijian, the deputy director general of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said China “has some unique difficulties” and is unable to match the U.S.’s ability to examine vaccine effectiveness in real-time as cases and deaths ebb. Hungary has started talks with Russia about the production of the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine, according to Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto.

The situation has worsened with daily cases and deaths at record levels, leading the government to impose fresh restrictions in late June. The Bank of Thailand has called repeatedly to boost liquidity to SMEs, which are seen as crucial to any economic recovery. So far, though, efforts to channel billions of dollars of credit at low interest rates, institute loan-payment holidays and offer credit guarantees have failed to breath life into the sector. “Credit growth to large corporates has been growing at over 10% a year. Even for the household sector, credit growth has also been growing at about 4% a year,” central bank Governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput said in March. “The segment where credit growth has been shrinking is the SMEs.” Thailand had 3.1 million small and medium-sized enterprises as of last year, employing 12.7 million people, according to government data. The Thai Chamber of Commerce believes the real number of SMEs could be as high as 5 million, since many smaller operators don’t register with the authorities. The sector accounted for 35% of the nation’s GDP at the end of first quarter, according to the Office of Small and Medium Enterprises Promotion. The central bank last month slashed its economic growth forecast for this year to 1.8%, from 3% previously, amid weak domestic consumption and repeated cuts to the tourism outlook. Before the pandemic tourism contributed about 20% of the country’s gross domestic product -- about double the global average -- but the bank now expects only 700,000 visitors to enter Thailand this year, down from almost 40 million in 2019. Patcharabhorn Salacheep, 34, who owns a body-painting business catering to foreigners, shut her Pattaya and Phuket outlets last year as the borders closed and tourism withered. After shedding 70% of her staff, she still has three shops in Bangkok’s Chatuchak weekend market but earns only about 10% of what she used to. She’s looking to borrow money to sustain the business, but isn’t sure if she’ll be approved for a bank loan. “If I don’t get it, my business may not survive this year,” Patcharabhorn said. “The government never compensated us for what we’re facing; what they offer are only debt restructuring and loans. They’re pushing us to create debts while we barely earn income.” The latest debt-relief measures for SMEs include 250 billion baht ($7.8 billion) in low-interest loans for business restructuring and 100 billion baht for an “asset warehouse,” where struggling businesses can temporarily park their distressed assets and get credit in return. Since the measures took effect in late April, about 24% of the total set aside for low-interest loans has been used, and less than 1% of the amount intended for the asset-warehouse plan. Bank of Thailand Governor Setaphut said demand for the asset warehouse is expected to pick up later. According to the SME federation, bank loans to smaller businesses total 3.5 trillion baht, including 240 billion baht that are nonperforming. Another 440 billion baht are rated scarcely higher and may turn bad by the end of the year if the economy doesn’t improve, according to the federation. More state help may be soon coming for small companies looking to upgrade their businesses. The government plans to cover 50% to 80% of the cost of boosting productivity, business management, marketing channels and overseas market development among others starting from Oct. 1, according to an official statement Monday. “Liquidity is not a silver bullet to cure everything,” said Naris Sathapholdeja, an economist at Bangkok-based TMBThanachart Bank Pcl. “Those who’ll get soft loans are those with business prospects and positive income. If you’re still in the debt-restructuring process with banks or can’t generate positive income, you’re unlikely to get the loans. Banks need to be careful under the current situation: No one wants to shoulder piles of bad debts once the situation eases.” Sethaput said not all SMEs will be approved for the relief measures. Those that should are the ones that can survive until the economy starts to recover. “Not all businesses that get loans will survive,” the governor said. “If we lend what we have to all groups, it may make those that should survive fail too. Everything has an opportunity cost.”"

Largely shut off from the rest of the world during the pandemic, the two sides have been in talks for months to revive the travel corridor. In statements and briefings Monday, they laid out details and requirements for would-be travelers, with Hong Kong saying people must have had two vaccine doses at least 14 days before flying. There’s no such requirement from Singapore. Cathay Pacific Airlines Ltd. and Singapore Airlines Ltd. will operate the flights, with the first Cathay trip slated to leave Hong Kong at 9:10 a.m. on May 26. Singapore Air’s departure that day is 8:40 a.m. They will start daily flights in the bubble from June 9 or 10. The agreement limits each flight to 200 travelers. The carriers’ shares rose more than 2% Monday. The travel bubble could lift traffic for both airlines by up to 3%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence transportation analyst James Teo, who called it a “small but significant step forward.” Preparations for the travel corridor between the two major financial hubs have stuttered ever since it was shelved in November after coronavirus cases picked up in Hong Kong. A recent plan to announce its revival was canceled last week by Singapore, people familiar with the matter said at the time. “It has been a long few months, but the conditions are now ripe again,” Singapore’s Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said in a statement. “Both sides will need to stay very vigilant in the next month, so that we can launch the first flights smoothly.” Despite occasional flare-ups, including at a dormitory for migrant workers in Singapore last week, Covid-19 caseloads in both cities are low and life is returning to normal. Hong Kong may reopen bars later this week and lengthen restaurant opening hours, among other steps to ease social distancing. Bringing outbreaks under control was key to opening the travel bubble. Hong Kong Commerce and Economic Development Secretary Edward Yau said the requirement to get vaccinated, which doesn’t apply to children under 16, was designed to encourage people to sign up for inoculations. Only about 11% of the Hong Kong population has received at least one dose of a vaccine, according to Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker -- less than half the rate in Singapore. Travelers will have to take Covid-19 tests and can’t have visited any places other than Hong Kong or Singapore in the two weeks before departure. Travelers from Hong Kong will have to use Singapore’s TraceTogether mobile app, while those coming from Singapore will need the LeaveHomeSafe app in Hong Kong. Records will be retained after the trip. Singapore Airlines called the travel bubble “an important milestone” in its recovery from the pandemic, while Cathay also welcomed the agreement and said it could be a showcase for the opening of similar lanes with other popular destinations. Fares on a return Singapore Airlines’ flight in economy class on May 26 jumped after the announcement to about S$968 ($730), from $618. Return economy tickets on Cathay were listed at HK$7,003 ($902) on the airline’s website, compared with HK$3,803 the previous day. Hong Kong and Singapore have tight restrictions on travel. The former has been essentially off limits to non-residents and even they face lengthy stays in designated quarantine facilities upon arrival, which means that many people haven’t traveled at all since the start of the pandemic more than a year ago. That’s been reflected in Cathay’s numbers: the airline flew just 598 passengers a day on average in March. Singapore last week eased restrictions on travelers from Hong Kong, who now can stay in home isolation for seven days rather than two weeks in a government-chosen hotel. Among its efforts to open up its borders, Singapore set up an area near Changi Airport to host business travelers without them needing to quarantine, provided they don’t leave the facility. The plan comes as other parts of the world take steps to reopen more widely for travel. The European Union will recommend loosening restrictions to allow in fully vaccinated U.S. tourists this summer, the New York Times reported. Greece is starting to allow U.S. travelers earlier if they’ve been vaccinated or have proof of a negative Covid-19 test. The U.S. government, meanwhile, has said it won’t issue so-called vaccine passports due to privacy concerns. Singapore has also proposed a travel bubble with Taiwan, Taipei-based Central News Agency reported Monday, citing Ong.  Disparate pandemic-related rules around the world have somewhat determined which vaccines people opt to take. In Hong Kong, there are two options, one made by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. and the other by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. China has so far only recognized Chinese-made shots, which means people eager to travel to the mainland have been more likely to sign up for Sinovac. But as its vaccines aren’t approved in the U.S. or Western Europe, those with family or business ties there are more inclined to take the other shot. As of Sunday in Hong Kong, about 688,100 Sinovac vaccine doses had been administered and the total for Pfizer-BioNTech was 587,100."

In a joint statement, the governments, along with Canada, expressed deep concern about steps taken by Lukashenko since his discredited declaration of victory in last year’s presidential election, including continuing attacks on human rights, fundamental freedoms and international law. Today the EU sends another strong signal of support to the people of Belarus by imposing further restrictive measures. Our message to the regime cannot be misunderstood: Release all political prisoners. Stop further repression.Start an inclusive national dialogue. pic.twitter.com/PqGHkvJFWL The most significant of the economic sanctions could be the restrictions imposed on potash sales. The soil nutrient is one of Belarus’s major exports and the country’s only abundant mineral resource. The specific segments that will be targeted by the sanctions are expected to hit about a quarter of the EU’s potash imports from Belarus, according to a person familiar with the proposals, but legal work on the measures needs to be finalized before the package is formally adopted. Last year, potash shipments netted Belaurs $2.4 billion, according to the national statistical committee.. Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg told reporters that the economic sanctions will affect seven sectors, including phosphate potassium, finance, telecom surveillance technology, and a further strengthening of the arms embargo. The EU is also expected to impose trade restrictions in the petroleum and petrochemical sector and export restrictions on supplies to the tobacco industry, as well as prohibit EU operators, including insurance companies, from providing services and new lending to the government in Belarus, the central bank and several majority state-owned entities, according to the person familiar with the proposals. The bloc is seeking to halt new lending from multilateral development banks, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. The EU had previously sanctioned seven Belarusian entities and 88 individuals, including Lukashenko himself, and was working on adding more people to the list even before the detention of the journalist Pratasevich. Other additions to the list includes ministers and other lawmakers, air force officers, business executives and companies supporting the regime, with Gutseriev being the most notable name on the new list. The majority of Gutseriev’s $3.2 billion fortune is derived from the energy sector where his family controls Neftisa, Russian petroleum products maker, and Russneft, country’s sixth largest oil company by crude oil production, according to Russneft’s website. The billionaire also owns a group of business centers, hotels and warehouses in Moscow and the surrounding area. His Safmar Group holds 60% stake in M.video PJSC, Russia’s biggest consumer electronics retailer. Gutseriev, 63, took his first steps in business at the end of the 1980s when he opened a private banks from an old police building in the Chechen capital, Grozny. After the Soviet Union collapsed, he opened another bank in Moscow and started a chain of stores selling gold jewelry. By the early 2000s, the billionaire founded his first business in the oil industry, creating Russneft in partnership with Glencore Plc. Gutseriev fled Russia in 2007, selling the business to a Kremlin-friendly oligarch for almost $3 billion after Moscow tax officials began raiding his offices amid a tax fraud probe. He returned three years later when the charges against him were dropped and repurchased Russneft. The billionaire also controls the Minsk-based company Slavkaliy that was created for exploration of the potash mine at the Starobin deposit in Belarus. In 2016, Gutseriev spent millions of dollars on his younger son’s wedding, which featured performances by Jennifer Lopez, Enrique Iglesias and Sting. EU governments also agreed to sanction several sectors of Belarus’s economy including industries connected to petroleum and the soil nutrient potash, as the bloc increases pressure on Lukashenko. Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, said that officials also discussed the separate package of economic sanctions and it will be presented to EU leaders at a summit later this week. “Certainly, there is not a magic wand, but this is the tool we have,” he told reporters in Luxembourg, adding that another round of sanctions is still possible. Belarus’s $750 million of bonds due in 2031 plummeted, sending the yield up about 70 basis points, the most since the debt was issued a year ago. The rate advanced to 8.35%, the highest on record. The bloc nearly doubled the number of individuals and entities previously sanctioned, adding 86 people and entities to its existing list. The new additions are mostly judges and high-ranking law enforcement officers. It added several top businessmen with close ties to Lukashenko, including Alexei Oleksin, whose interests range from oil trade to tobacco business. The EU also sanctioned Russian billionaire Mikhail Gutseriev, describing him as a long-time friend of the president. The Biden administration sanctioned the top prosecutor in Belarus, as well as Lukashenko’s top spokeswoman, other associates and a prison where the U.S. alleges Lukashenko’s regime has tortured political opponents. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that action was taken in response to the Ryanair diversion and “the continuing repression in Belarus, including attacks on human rights, democratic processes, and fundamental freedoms.” The U.S. also sanctioned Natallia Kachanava, chairwoman of Belarus’s upper house of parliament, and several people and organizations alleged to have been involved in the August election and a violent crackdown on protesters afterward. They include Andrei Shved, the prosecutor general, who has issued arrest warrants and extradition requests against Lukashenko opponents, including Raman Pratasevich, the journalist arrested from the Ryanair flight forced to land in Minsk."

The settlement, for an undisclosed sum, followed the leak of the personal data of 420,000 customers and staff, including bank details, contact information and addresses. The deal between IAG-owned British Airways and law firm PGMBM doesn’t include any admission of liability by the airline. “The pace at which we have been able to resolve this process with British Airways has been particularly encouraging and demonstrates how seriously the legal system is taking mass data incidents,” said Harris Pogust, chairman of PGMBM, said in an emailed statement. British Airways has been rocked by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its industry. In October, the U.K. Information Commissioner’s Office reduced the airline’s fine for the breach from 183 million pounds ($254 million) to 20 million pounds in the wake of the pandemic’s financial impact. The case was filed under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which ramped up potential fines for firms failing to protect consumers’ control of their personal data. British Airways’ rival, EasyJet Plc, also faces a lawsuit led by PGMBM after exposing private details of nine million passengers. British Airways said in an emailed statement that it “apologized to customers who may have been affected by this issue and are pleased we’ve been able to settle the group action.” When “the issue arose we acted promptly to protect and inform our customers,” the carrier said."

Airline operations have been suspended in Canada since Jan. 29 because of Covid-19 restrictions. As a result, revenue at Transat has all but vanished, dropping 99% from a year earlier in the quarter that ended April 30. In April, Transat obtained C$700 million ($579 million) in emergency aid from the Canadian government. “The financing we secured will allow us to roll out our plan over the coming years,” Chief Executive Officer Annick Guerard, who took over from Jean-Marc Eustache last month. Guerard pledged to make the company “more profitable than before the pandemic.” The company has also been hit hard by stringent Canadian entry and quarantine rules and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s request to halt travel to Mexico and the Caribbean to slow the spread of new virus variants. Now the government is starting to loosen restrictions for fully vaccinated Canadian residents. Transat’s entry into the hotel business was new, begun in 2018 with the purchase of two oceanfront lots in Puerto Morelos, Mexico.

The country’s 1.4-billion-strong population is eager to travel, the yuan is rallying and oil is getting cheaper. A Bloomberg gauge of the sector shows nine of the world’s top 10 airline stocks over the past three months are Chinese, with all but Air China Ltd. shares posting double-digit gains. The odd one out is InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., which operates India’s biggest carrier, IndiGo. That’s sixth on the list with a 13% advance. The top performer is low-cost carrier Spring Airlines Co., which has climbed 22%. Stock gains have accelerated this month, in part on the yuan’s strength. That lowers the airlines’ costs on fuel as well as debt, some of which is borrowed in U.S. dollars. Recent oil price declines further cap fuel expenses, which unlike many carriers Chinese airlines don’t hedge. Still, China’s big three - Air China, China Southern Airlines Co. and China Eastern Airlines Corp. - are expected to be unprofitable in the second half of this year, according to analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. They each posted first-half losses of more than 8 billion yuan ($1.2 billion). But optimism has been increasing. Traffic is expected to be bolstered by the National Day holiday in early October. Further down the line, domestic air traffic levels in 2021 could be 15% higher than in 2019, according to China International Capital Corp. The global airline industry has been walloped by the coronavirus pandemic, as governments imposed unprecedented border restrictions and people became more reluctant to travel. The International Air Transport Association, which represents some 290 airlines, doesn’t expect passenger traffic to recover to pre-pandemic levels before 2024. Chinese carriers haven’t been immune to the crisis, but they’ve managed to recover much faster thanks to a vast domestic market and the removal of travel curbs as the outbreak there was brought under control."

The U.S. tourism industry is seeing a recovery during the crucial summer season, according to a Federal Reserve report released Wednesday. The Beige Book survey, based on information gathered by the Fed’s 12 district banks from late May to early July, showed some businesses reporting record demand for leisure hotels and air travel, particularly in outdoor vacation destinations such as Cape Cod. Cities such as New York and Washington, D.C. also saw a rebound in visitors.  However, growth was held back by continuing labor shortages, which have led some businesses to reduce capacity and increase wages. Demand for business travel remains weak, the Beige Book found. Related: Fed Says Economy Strengthening Amid Disruptions, Labor Shortages Following is a look at some of the reports on the tourism industry from Fed district banks: “In New York City, hotel occupancy rates climbed above 60% in June, a post-pandemic high, though room rates have remained well below pre-pandemic levels. With most restrictions now lifted, many more New York City hotels, restaurants, museums, and entertainment venues have re-opened or eased capacity constraints.” “A survey of residents across the Northeast indicated that many are eager to visit New York City, and the city recently launched a large promotional campaign to draw more domestic visitors.” “Some beach communities reported record visitation, as hotels saw record-breaking occupancy and beach short-term rentals were booked solid through the summer and into the fall.” “Many hotels and restaurants continued to report labor shortages that led them to limit capacity or services. Contacts attributed demand to domestic travel, and visitation to the District of Columbia strengthened but remained below pre-pandemic levels.” “Hoteliers and restaurateurs reported significant improvement in activity as pandemic fears waned, and a contact at a large airport said that leisure travelers drove a strong rebound in air travel that exceeded her expectations.” “Hotel bookings, occupancy rates, and room rates on Cape Cod held steady or improved further in a record-breaking spring season.” “Aside from potential problems related to ongoing labor shortages, retail and hospitality contacts remained optimistic that the summer would continue to yield very strong results.” “Travel industry respondents reported that air travel through Boston increased substantially in recent months. Compared with the comparable months from 2019, passengers were at 40% as of April 2021, at 45% as of May, and are expected to surpass 50% in June and July.” “Spending on leisure and hospitality services continued to rebound. Contacts noted especially strong recoveries at restaurants, casinos, and concessionaires at sporting venues and national parks.” “Atlanta, Miami and Orlando were among the top destination cities for Memorial Day weekend, kickstarting the summer travel season.

The planemaker is installing 20 overhead air vents with special 3D-printed nozzles to create a “curtain of air” in a new 737 Max 9 jet, Doug Christensen, a Boeing technical fellow, told reporters Thursday. Alaska Airlines contributed the so-called ecoDemonstrator aircraft to test new technologies over the next five months. “If you got on a plane and the person in front of you sneezes and those particles are floating around, it makes you nervous,” said Christensen, who is also the ecoDemonstrator program technical leader. “Those nozzles will actually drive air down and away from the breathing area, and cause the particles to be recirculated and cleaned.” The ecoDemonstrator is the eighth commercial airliner that’s served as a flying testbed since 2012 to try out 195 projects dreamed up by Boeing’s engineers. This year’s effort features about 20 promising technologies, including the following: A new fire-extinguishing agent for airplane engines that significantly reduces damage to the ozone layer versus Halon 1301, which is no longer being produced. Recycling carbon-composite scraps left over from production of its 777X wing into cabin sidewall panels. “Acoustic gloves” in engine covers known as nacelles to help make airplanes quieter."

Kahului, Hawaii (AP) -- Officials on Maui are moving quickly to implement a new tax on tourists. The move comes after state lawmakers overrode a veto by Hawaii Gov. David Ige this week. Hawaii lawmakers overrode Ige’s veto of a bill that overhauls how the state funds the Hawaii Tourism Authority and allocates tourism tax revenue to the counties. The new law allows Hawaii's counties to collect a 3% tax from visitors staying at hotels and other short-term rentals. Before the new law, the state collected a 10% hotel tax and distributed a share to each county. Now, the counties can levy their own surcharge to the tax and keep the money for local needs. The bill would stop funding the tourism agency with money raised by the transient accommodations tax. Lawmakers intend to pay for the agency with money from the general fund, though for the current fiscal year they appropriated federal coronavirus relief funds. “This will help tremendously,” said Maui County Council Chair Alice Lee. Lee said that will bring Maui nearly triple the revenue, Hawaii News Now reported Thursday. “Instead of $23 million, we’ll probably receive in the neighborhood of $50 to $70 million,” Lee said. Maui has seen a sharp increase in tourism since pandemic restrictions have eased. State Rep. Sylvia Luke, the House Finance Chair, said under the old system, Oahu got the bulk of the money because it is the most populous island in the state. Now counties will be receive money based on how many visitors they get. Luke said Maui could benefit the most. “The island is just overrun with tourists,” said Luke. “And you look at the population of Maui, compared to Oahu, there’s a lot more tourists per capita.” California visitors Phil and Diana Asenas think the law is unfair. “Taking a little bit of an advantage of people who truly want to get out and have been locked down for two years now,” said Phil Asenas. “They’re definitely taking advantage of us,” Diana Asenas said. ""But at the same time, if we want a vacation, we have to suck it up too. But it’s not right. It’s definitely not right.”"

But the country has remained an important fly-over territory for airliners, particularly since parts of neighboring Ukraine were deemed unsafe to traverse in the wake of the 2014 downing of a Malaysian Airlines aircraft. About 400 flights a day use Belarus airspace, including about 300 that pass over without landing, according to Eurocontrol, which is responsible for managing Europe’s airspace. Now European airlines have begun skirting around Belarus at the directive of European Union leaders. Images from FlightRadar show that airlines are starting to avoid Belarus in response to the forced landing of a Ryanair jet in Minsk. ( Source: Bloomberg) The airspace over Belarus is part of a major through-way for flights between Asia and Europe. The country charges airlines between 245 euros ($300) for an Airbus SE A320 jet to as much as 770 euros for an A380 super-jumbo to use their airspace, Eurocontrol said. In 2019, Eurocontrol collected 85 million euros in air navigation charges on behalf of Belarus, it said. Barring overflight by European airlines may deprive Belarus of as much as half of its air transit fees, said Oleksandr Laneckij of aviation consultancy Friendly Avia Support. Similarly, state airline Belavia could see a halving of its annual revenue, which totaled about $210 million in 2020, Laneckij said. The U.K. suspended the carrier’s operating permit that lets it land abroad, and some EU countries have followed suit. The commercial aviation industry has become more accustomed to no-fly zones, be it because of erupting volcanoes in Iceland or Indonesia, conflicts on the ground that can threaten aircraft passing overhead or a politically motivated ban, as was the case for several years for Qatar, which wasn’t able until recently to pass through Saudi Arabia and other allied countries. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia closed its airspace to Israeli flights, news service Channel 13 reported, leading to delays. Short-haul carriers such as Wizz Air Holdings Plc and Ryanair have also begun flying circuitous routes around Belarus on some of their services, according to airplane tracking website FlightRadar24. Belavia, meanwhile, has canceled some flights. It usually operates 20 routes to 17 EU countries, including four destinations in Germany, according to aviation consultancy Cirium. While it would depend on the route, avoiding Belarus will have a bigger impact on short-haul journeys that normally pass through the region, according to John Strickland, a consultant at London-based JLS Consulting. Conversely, long-distance flights have more time and flexibility to reroute, though the latest no-fly zone adds to to the industry’s growing list of restrictions in the pandemic The move follows international furor over the interception on May 23 of a Ryanair Holdings Plc jetliner, which was forced to land in Minsk en route from Greece to Lithuania so that authorities could arrest a dissident Belarusian journalist who was on board. On Tuesday, long-haul airliners belonging to Air France-KLM, Deutsche Lufthansa AG and British Airways began flying over Latvia instead of the traditional route over Belarus, adding extra distance and time to the flights. Most carriers overflying Belarus will be re-routed through the Baltic states, Eurocontrol said, which might add about 40 nautical miles to their journeys."

A three-hour British Airways flight from Faro, in the popular Algarve region, to London City airport on Monday night costs 711 pounds ($1,000), according to comparison website Skyscanner. The following day, when passengers will be subject to 10 days of self-isolation on arrival, the airline is offering flights to Heathrow for 80% less. U.K. authorities caught airlines and holidaymakers by surprise on Thursday with a decision to remove Portugal from the green list of countries where people can easily travel. The abrupt move echoes the disruption that took hold last summer, when sudden changes to quarantine rules forced vacationers to rush home at short notice. Now carriers are hastily rearranging schedules and contemplating another high season lost to the pandemic. “The government has torn up its own rule book and ignored the science, throwing peoples’ plans into chaos,” said EasyJet Plc Chief Executive Officer Johan Lundgren Thursday. “This decision essentially cuts the U.K. off from the rest of the world.” Holidaymakers set to travel to Portugal in coming days are seeing the prospect of some time in the sun evaporate. Charlie Turner, 28, from the Wirral near Liverpool was due to fly with his aunt from Birmingham to Faro on June 10 for a long weekend. She is a carer for ill family members and unable to quarantine on return. They are seeking a refund. “The restrictions and quarantine make it near impossible to take short-term trips -- it’s just not feasible,” he said. Less than a month ago, airlines rushed to add seats to Portugal when it became the only major sun-spot green-listed in the U.K.’s traffic-light system that began on May 17. The industry expected this week’s review to produce an expansion of the list, with Spain’s Balearic islands and Malta potential inclusions. But no countries were added to the green list and Portugal is now going amber, causing disruption to the many Britons who were relying on the setup to bring certainty to summer travel plans. Many Brits own holiday or retirement homes in Portugal. Travellers don’t have an automatic right to a refund if a country moves down the U.K.’s traffic-light list, according to consumer magazine Which? travel. They can rebook, but the millions of holidays rescheduled from earlier in the pandemic mean the new dates are often more expensive, said editor Rory Boland. “For most people with holidays and almost everybody with flights, your decision is going to be rebooking and often paying hundreds of pounds more,” he said. “If you can’t do that, you’ll lose the cost of the holiday.” With their share prices dropping for a second day and prospects shrinking, airlines are revising their plans. EasyJet is focused on gearing up its fleet within the European Union, it said, where the bloc’s reopening is proceeding in a more urgent manner. Read: France Loosens Entry Rules for Vaccinated EU Travelers Package-holiday operator Jet2 Plc said Friday it would delay its restart by one week to July 1, while British Airways, owned by IAG SA, is increasing the number of flights from Portugal to help customers get back before the restrictions kick in. For Portuguese hotels and restaurants, the U.K. move is “disastrous,” according to Portugal’s Tourism Confederation. Tourism accounts for about 15% of Portugal’s economy and 9% of employment, with Britons ranking as the biggest group of visitors. Raul Martins, chairman of the Altis hotel chain and head of Portugal’s Hotel Association, said there have been “massive” cancellations in the Algarve as a result of the decision, which he branded as “excessive.” Portugal has queried the U.K.’s justification for moving it to the amber list. “We take note of the British decision to remove Portugal from the travel ‘green list,’ the logic of which we cannot understand,” Portugal’s foreign minister, Augusto Santos Silva, said on Twitter. The country has “clear rules for the safety of those who live here and those who visit us.”"

U.K. airline capacity remains stuck at about one-tenth of 2019 levels, as the government weighs a May 17 target to restart international travel. Israel, where almost 55% of the population has been fully vaccinated, is preparing to welcome visitors in groups from May 23 if they can show they’ve had the jab. In the U.K., about half the population has received at least one dose. The government, determined to protect hard-won success bringing down infection rates, has said it’ll look at the data early next month on which countries should be green-listed in its traffic-light system, before making a final decision on the May 17 target to lift the ban on non-essential travel. Airlines have clamored for Britain to lead the way toward a reopening in the region. Wizz Air Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Jozsef Varadi said this week that he was no longer counting on a rebound in European air travel during this summer’s high season, citing travel restrictions and problems with vaccine rollouts. Where Can You Fly Right Now? Tracking the Return to the Skies Why the Mutated Coronavirus Variants Are So Worrisome: QuickTake Israel has led the world in vaccinations, and while eager to restart tourism, the government has said it will reopen only in stages starting May 23. Groups will go first because they’re easier to monitor, according to Haaretz. No date has been set to allow individual travelers, and health officials will be monitoring infection rates before making a decision. The nearby United Arab Emirates has remained open to air travel for months, while focusing on rapid vaccinations. Yet its long-distance hubs in Dubai and Abu Dhabi are hovering at about 50% of capacity, dependent on big countries in Europe and Asia to lift curbs. Asia has generally relied on social-distancing measures to keep infection rates low. Singapore has one of the highest vaccination rates in the region, with about 20% of its population receiving at least one dose. Visits from low-risk countries like New Zealand are allowed in certain circumstances. Under one program, business visitors stay in a confined zone near Changi Airport and conduct meetings with locals through a glass wall. Dominant Singapore Airlines Ltd. has been hit hard by travel restrictions because the city-state has no local aviation market. The government is in talks with several countries to set up air travel bubbles, including Hong Kong and Australia. Hungary has administered at least a first vaccine dose to more than 30% of its population. Still, daily infection levels remain elevated, and virus mortality is among the highest in Europe. While foreigners are still barred from entry for personal travel, the Eastern European country has kept its borders open for freight transit. With airline capacity 92% below 2019 levels, the government is eager to vaccinated host soccer fans in June at the Euro 2021 soccer tournament. Decision makers face a tough balancing act. A second summer in a row without significant air travel would deal a major setback to an already struggling aviation industry, and also to hotels, shops and restaurants that rely on tourism. Meanwhile, there are concerns that premature reopenings will help spread newer strains of the coronavirus and undermine progress toward slowing the spread of the disease. The U.S. may provide a test case. The country has struggled to keep infection rates down, even as a powerful vaccination campaign gathers pace. While international trips to most destinations are still off-limits, domestic capacity is ramping up, with airlines planning to add flights in coming weeks. Chile is already in full retreat. The Latin American country secured supplies from China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. and has fully vaccinated more than a quarter of its population. After reopening for air travel in November, it has now backtracked, closing its borders to most this month in response to a spike in Covid-19 cases."

The world’s biggest long-haul airline will retrofit the seats -- which offer more room than coach at a cheaper price than business class -- into planes supplied by Amedeo Air Four Plus Ltd., the leasing firm said in a statement Wednesday. The change should help adapt the Emirates fleet to a post-Covid travel market in which well-heeled leisure passengers may be prepared to pay more for extra personal space amid continuing health concerns, even as demand for business trips remains subdued or switches to less costly options. Though Emirates, the largest A380 operator, said at the end of 2020 that its last few new double-deckers would feature premium economy, President Tim Clark only revealed last month that it would convert older ones. Four-class jets will have 56 premium-economy seats, according a December statement, with the number in coach dropping to 338 to accommodate them. The A380s will still have 76 business and 14 first-class berths. Dubai-based Emirates has been a late convert to attractions of an upscale coach, which was first introduced at Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. and Taiwan’s EVA Air in the early 1990s. Superjumbo operators including British Airways, Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Qantas Airways Ltd. have long offered the product on their planes, while Deutsche Lufthansa AG introduced it in 2015. Emirates aimed to incorporate premium economy on Boeing Co.’s 777X wide-body last year but switched to deployment on the A380 when that program hit delays. A single new superjumbo was delivered with the cabin in January and five yet to be delivered from Airbus are expected to be similarly equipped.

It could be a month or more however before European sanctions take effect, while the U.S. administration didn’t indicate when it might act. Macron expressed frustration at the limits on the West’s ability to influence the behavior of Belarusian strongman, Alexander Lukashenko, in office since 1994, or his closest ally in Russia. “It’s not obvious what else can be done,” Macron said Tuesday, repeatedly asking a reporter what other measures could be more productive. “You yourself don’t know what to say -- in this case, do we start an armed conflict? Do we entirely cut off relations? We already did that. We go further but to where?” Lukashenko has already withstood years of Western pressure thanks to support from Russia and China, while deepening a crackdown on the opposition that began after protests against his claim of a landslide election victory last summer. Pratasevich, who told allies before the flight from Athens to Vilnius that he was being watched, appeared in a brief video released by Belarusian authorities Monday night. Speaking with little expression, he said he was feeling well and has confessed to charges of fomenting mass unrest. While he said was being treated “appropriately,” his allies said he appeared to have been beaten. His lawyer said she hasn’t been able to speak to her client. His girlfriend Sofia Sapega, a Russian citizen, was also taken from the flight and shown Tuesday in a video saying she runs a social media channel that violated Belarusian law.  Accused of torturing prisoners, Belarusian authorities have regularly released such “confession” videos from detainees in the months since the protests began last summer. The crackdown shows no signs of letting up, with a court in Mogilev Tuesday sentencing seven opposition activists and bloggers to sentences of up to seven years in prison each for organizing mass unrest -- the same charge to which Pratasevich confessed in the video. The video “makes for deeply distressing viewing,” U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Twitter Tuesday. “Belarus’ actions will have consequences.” The EU’s tougher stance against Belarus coincided with a scheduled discussion on its close ally Russia. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda called for measures to limit Russia’s access to financial markets and international payment systems. Von der Leyen said that Russia has tried to weaken the EU and undermine member states through “sabotage, assassinations, divide-and-rule tactics, cyber-attacks, disinformation campaigns.” “It is getting worse,” she said. The EU leaders asked the commission to set out options for pushing back against Putin when they meet next month. All the same, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted that -- despite speculation by British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab -- there is no evidence to show that Russia had a hand in Pratasevich’s arrest. “We had no reliable information about Russia’s role yesterday, therefore we also didn’t make any assessment along those lines,” she told reporters after the EU summit. “When I talk to the Russian president, this topic will surely also be on the agenda. But we cannot operate with speculation at the moment.” WATCH: IATA Director General Willie Walsh discusses the response of the aviation industry after the forced landing of a Ryanair Holdings. (Source: Bloomberg) Russia state television praised Belarus’s handing of the situation, while Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called Raab’s accusation “obsessive Russophobia.” In a public show of support, President Vladimir Putin will meet Lukashenko later this week, for the third time this year. Putin and Biden are due to meet June 16 for their first summit. The EU has already imposed sanctions on dozens of individuals and seven entities, including Lukashenko and other senior government officials, and was already working on a new round of measures to present next month. In light of this weekend’s incident and the mandate provided by EU leaders, those new restrictive measures are likely to now be tougher. In addition to adding more people and entities to the list, the bloc could set out action targeting the financial and economic interests of the regime, including companies and businesses owners with ties to the ruling elite. The proposals will be prepared by the EU’s foreign affairs arm before they go back to member states for approval. The U.K. closed its airspace to the country’s airline on Tuesday, a move the EU is planning after asking carriers based in the bloc to avoid flying over Belarus. The 27 European Union leaders meeting in Brussels vowed to add more Belarusian officials to an existing sanctions list and broaden punitive measures that would target companies and the whole sectors of the economy, while demanding the immediate release of 26-year-old Raman Pratasevich. U.S. President Joe Biden welcomed the EU response to what he called “a direct affront to international norms” and asked advisers for options hold the people responsible accountable."

India expanded an emergency credit program to airlines and hospitals to cushion them from the impact of a wave of coronavirus infections and deaths. The loans, which were previously intended for specific sectors such as small borrowers, can be availed until Sept. 30 or until total guarantees worth 3 trillion rupees ($41 billion) are offered, the Finance Ministry said in a statement Sunday. So far, about 2.5 trillion rupees have been disbursed, Sunil Mehta, chief executive of the Indian Banks’ Association, said at a briefing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration is turning focus to protecting the economy as a devastating surge of Covid-19 infections ebb. While he eschewed a national lockdown in favor of localized mobility curbs, demand is still weak following a recession last year and as the recent wave of infections killed more than 150,000 people amid a severe shortage of basic medical facilities such as hospital beds and oxygen. “With the second wave and incremental stress on debt servicing of the borrowers, relief measures under the loan guarantee scheme will support liquidity position of the borrowers,” said Anil Gupta, vice president for financial sector ratings at ICRA Ltd. “The government will not be burdened with additional cost because of the second wave and this will also improve the utilization of overall funding pool available under the plan.” The overall size of the program could be expanded pending cabinet approval, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Some aspects of a central bank borrowing window for Covid-affected individuals and medical sectors may also be included under the government guarantee program, they said, asking not to be identified citing rules. Calls to a spokesman at the Ministry of Finance were unanswered outside of business hours. The enhanced program will guarantee loans worth 20 million rupees to hospitals and clinics to set up on-site oxygen generation plants. Interest rates will be capped at 7.5%. Small companies can borrow an additional 30% of their credit limit, up from 20% announced last year. Some eligible borrowers can extend the tenor of their loans by a year. “These are more proactive steps that are being taken to offer mitigation to the hardship that the sector might experience,” Dinesh Khara, chairman of State Bank of India, said at a media briefing on Sunday. It’s too early for any bank to say with “definitive certainty” the impact the second wave of the pandemic has had on small and medium businesses, he said."

The plan, unveiled Wednesday by the Northeast Corridor Commission, proposes to speed Acela travel times from New York City to Washington, D.C. by 26 minutes, to Boston by 28 minutes, and to New Haven, Conn. by 25 minutes. When completed by 2035, it would increase daily Amtrak service by 33% and add 60 million new rail trips each year.  The rail improvement plan was developed with input from state governments in the Northeast, federal officials, commuter rail agencies, and Amtrak. “The investments in infrastructure laid out in this plan will lead to more modern, reliable, and faster trains, expanded service, and a better customer experience - that will benefit customers, economies and local communities along the entire Northeast Corridor and beyond,” Stephen Gardner, president of Amtrak, said in a statement. The Northeast Corridor Commission has identified several pots of money that could be used for the plan, including funds for the Gateway Program between New York and New Jersey. Of the plan’s total cost, $100 billion is unfunded and the coalition proposes that the federal government jointly cover it with states. The proposed plan comes as the administration and a group of senators recently agreed to a bipartisan infrastructure framework that would include $66 billion for passenger and freight rail. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said in a statement that he will “fight for quick Congressional action to fund this transformative program and bring it to fruition.” Amit Bose, deputy administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration and a co-chair of the commission, said in a statement that the plan “supports new travel patterns as our economy returns to full strength.” The plan would support more than 150 projects along the corridor. It proposes starting construction on Gateway’s Hudson Tunnel Project by 2025.  The plan would also address accessibility and upgrading facilities to meet Americans With Disabilities Act requirements, Kevin Corbett, President and CEO of NJ Transit and an NEC Commission co-chair said. “When you have 100-plus year-old infrastructure, to be ADA-compliant, it takes billions of dollars to overhaul all these stations,” he said.

The carrier will cut about 3,500 jobs by the fiscal year ending 2022 and will seek to temporarily transfer employees to Toyota Motor Corp. and other Japanese automakers, the Yomiuri newspaper reported over the weekend. An ANA spokesman confirmed that employees will be dispatched, without providing further details. The global airline industry is in a state of paralysis amid the ongoing effects of the pandemic, with carriers slashing jobs and seeking funds to ride out the crisis. United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. both posted steep losses, while Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. is cutting thousands of jobs and closing a regional carrier. “It will be necessary to raise new funds immediately” if ANA posts a loss of about 500 billion yen, said Yasuhito Tsuchiya, a senior analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley. Japan’s largest airline, ANA is planning to secure about 400 billion yen ($3.8 billion) in subordinated loans to keep operations afloat, while Japan Airlines Co. is seeking to raise about 200 billion to 300 billion yen in subordinated loans, the Kyodo news agency reported on Monday. Subordinated loans are usually given to debt-heavy or financially weak borrowers to bolster their financial health, because credit rating companies count part of such loans as capital, helping the businesses enhance their credit status. For lenders, they are riskier than straight loans but typically carry higher interest rates. A spokeswoman for JAL declined to comment on the loan report, saying that nothing has been decided and that the carrier has secured plenty of liquidity. Shares of ANA fell 1.1% in Tokyo on Monday. The stock is down 35% this year. ANA is projected to post a loss of 81 billion yen for the fiscal second quarter that ended in September, versus 45 billion yen in net income a year earlier, according to the average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. They predict sales will decline 58% to 231 billion yen. ANA is on track to post a record full-year loss of about 530 billion yen, the Kyodo news agency reported last week. ANA will also sell about 30 wide-body aircraft because of their low fuel-efficiency and high maintenance costs, the Yomiuri reported. It will utilize its customer data to offer financial and other services, while arranging code-sharing with its budget carrier, Peach Aviation Ltd., according to the report. In fiscal year 2021, the company will cut about 80 billion yen in costs, the paper said. Japan’s national Go To tourism campaign has helped support domestic travel, but demand is far from returning to pre-pandemic levels. ANA and JAL are both forecasting domestic passengers to drop by about 50% this month. Domestic airline Star Flyer Inc. is considering raising about 10 billion yen in capital, the Yomiuri said in a separate report. ANA is the largest shareholder of Star Flyer and holds 18% of the carrier. Although event risks such as natural disasters and epidemic are inevitable for the aviation industry, the carriers probably didn’t expect the impact of coronavirus to be this huge, according to Shunsuke Oshida, credit analyst at Manulife Asset Management. “The difficult part is that we can’t see how much their credit ratings may fall,” Oshida said."

The company sees an end to net losses when business and international traffic recover to 65% of 2019 levels, but it didn’t predict when that would happen or quantify the current decline. Generating adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is on the table when demand in those segments gets back to 30% of pre-pandemic levels, United said Monday evening. “We’ve shifted our focus to the next milestone on the horizon and now see a clear path to profitability,” United Chief Executive Officer Scott Kirby said in a statement. He said he was “encouraged by the strong evidence of pent-up demand for air travel.” The carrier’s guarded optimism echoes a similar tone from Delta Air Lines Inc., which last week posted a worse-than-anticipated quarterly loss but predicted summer gains in passenger loads. While new virus variants are grabbing headlines amid a fresh surge in global Covid-19 infections, expanding U.S. vaccination rates are bolstering airline ticket sales after more than a year in which most Americans stayed close to home. United fell 6.2% to $51.60 at 9:59 a.m. Tuesday in New York. The shares had advanced 27% this year through Monday, in line with the gains of a Standard & Poor’s index of big U.S. airlines. But rising doubts about the travel outlook have spurred nine straight days of declines on the industry stock gauge, the longest streak since 2009. “While the comments were likely made to show where break-even can occur during the recovery, investors may be interpreting them as an expectation that it will take longer than anticipated for business and international travel to recover fully,” Helane Becker, an analyst at Cowen & Co., said in a note to clients. Adding to the uncertain outlook for airlines, the U.S. State Department said it was changing the way it issues travel advisories to reflect the prevalence of the coronavirus -- a move it said will result in about 80% of the world’s nations being considered no-go zones. United plans to hold a conference call to discuss its results with analysts at 10:30 a.m. New York time Tuesday. Rivals American Airlines Group Inc., Southwest Airlines Co. and Alaska Air Group Inc. all report earnings on April 22. The company’s adjusted loss -- its fifth in a row -- worsened to $7.50 a share in the first quarter, trailing the average shortfall of $7.02 that analysts had predicted. Higher fuel costs added to expenses even as the Chicago-based company continued to grapple with a severe lack of demand. Sales tumbled 60% to $3.22 billion, slightly less than the $3.25 billion expected by Wall Street. The revenue decline since the same period of 2019 was 66%. United said it ended the first quarter with $21 billion in liquidity, including $7 billion it hasn’t tapped from a U.S. government loan program. For the second quarter, the carrier forecast an adjusted Ebitda margin of around minus 20%. United airline plans to operate more than half its pre-pandemic capacity in the three-month period, which will be 45% lower than the same period in 2019. First-quarter capacity was 54% below 2019 levels. United has the largest international network among the three major U.S. legacy carriers, a group that also includes Delta and American. That makes United more vulnerable to the plunge in overseas flying. International passenger volumes were down 56% from pre-pandemic levels as of last week, according to Airlines for America, a trade group. Flying on lucrative routes to such countries as the U.K. and Japan is severely depressed, even as trips to Mexico are nearing their pre-pandemic level. United is also highly reliant on corporate traffic, which remains depressed even as leisure trips rebound. Travel agencies’ ticket sales to the corporate sector were down 78% as of last week, according to the Airlines Reporting Corp."

But doing so is a risky move all its own. “We don’t have a lot of time,” says Beks Ndlovu, founder of African Bush Camps, of the scramble to preserve Africa’s wilderness areas, which are increasingly threatened by environmental factors such as climate change, human-wildlife conflict, and a lack of funding. With 15 lodges across Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Zambia, Ndlovu is on the front lines of a battle that he says “is closing in on us.” Nvodlu is among the safari operators that has realized in the past year that the current tourism model needs a rethink, despite decades of insistence that visitor revenues would sustain wilderness areas, surrounding villages, and the animals. That’s in part because of Covid-19, which halted visitor revenues entirely and left tourism-funded reserves across Africa  unable to pay their rangers and anti-poaching units. And it’s partially because of long-accepted industry norms, which include hefty travel agent commissions that chip away at profits that can be directed toward conservation."

Since then Israel and Iran have accused each other of explosions targeting shipping. In November, Iran pledged to avenge the killing of a top nuclear scientist, an assassination it blamed on Israel and the U.S. The security council said in its statement that it believes Iran will continue to try and hit Israeli targets in the near future. The UAE has become a popular tourist destination for Israelis after ties were established last year, but travel was halted for most of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

A rental car facility at the airport in one of America’s biggest boomtowns is selling bonds, the first such debt offering of its kind since the pandemic began. The Austin, Texas facility refinanced about $147 million of bonds to help ease debt service payments -- giving it more than enough breathing room to stay afloat until the pandemic is over. The deal comes as the U.S. is vaccinating nearly 1.5 million Americans a day, and coronavirus cases across the nation are on the decline. “Now there’s more of a consensus that this part of the economy has made it through a challenging time,” said Daniel Solender, director of tax-free fixed income for Lord, Abbett & Co., which is looking at the Austin deal. “Now there’s an end in sight. Definitely optimism.” Final pricing for the Austin deal came in with yields between 50 basis points and 160 basis points above Treasuries, reflecting stronger demand for the earlier-maturity debt and weaker demand for securities with the longest due dates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s compared with preliminary pricing wires reflecting spreads between 55 basis points and 130 basis points. The investment-grade-rated facility is joining dozens of cities, hotels, museums, airports and toll roads that have been using the steep drop in borrowing costs to push off debt payments or cut them by refinancing. That’s helped keep distress relatively rare in the $3.9 trillion market, despite the myriad stresses issuers have faced. Doug Benton, a senior municipal credit manager at Cavanal Hill, said the strong market conditions are a “silver lining” for borrowers who can ease the financial burden of the pandemic by refinancing. It also shows how far the state and local debt market has come. Less than a year ago, munis were on the precipice of a deep selloff that sent interest rates skyrocketing and scuttled billions in bond deals. “Now we’re one-hundred and eighty degrees from that,” he said. The offering comes amid strong demand for state and local debt. Investors are pouring money into muni mutual funds. Inflows reached $2.79 billion during one week in January, the second biggest influx ever, and these funds have seen inflows for 13 straight weeks. The Austin facility is rated A3, four levels above junk, by Moody’s Investors Service and an equivalent A- by Fitch Ratings with a negative outlook by Fitch because of the uncertainty around air travel. U.S. Transportation Security Administration traveler checkpoints have recovered from a low of 87,534 passengers in April, averaging more than 706,000 passengers per day in the first week of February, but the numbers are still far below this period last year, where an average of 2 million passengers passed through airport security. The lack of travel has had a major impact on the finances of airports and the facilities they run. This includes rental car facilities, which were already facing pre-pandemic challenges from the rise of ride-sharing services operated by Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc., according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Kazatsky. Over the past year, credit rating companies have downgraded rental car facility bonds for similar projects located at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. S&P Global Ratings rates 14 consolidated rental car facilities borrowers with about $2.8 billion in outstanding debt, according to analyst Todd Spence. The ratings company downgraded the credit rating on all but one of those borrowers in 2020. “Despite some of the challenges, or issues people are well aware of, I’d be surprised if there wasn’t extreme demand,” Jeff Timlin, a managing director at Sage Advisory Services, said of the Austin deal. “There’s so much money out there that needs to be put to work.”"

The Seoul-based startup said it plans to use the money to expand geographically and push efforts to bring digital technologies to the travel and hospitality industry. The deal will boost Yanolja’s valuation to more than 10 trillion won ($9 billion), according to people familiar with the matter. The company declined to comment on the latest valuation and the amount of stake that SoftBank will acquire. SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son has been expanding his investments in South Korea, a strategy that paid off as Coupang Inc. pulled off the country’s largest IPO in more than a decade. The e-commerce giant helped SoftBank post the highest profit ever for a Japanese company in May, and paved the way for a wave of Korean startup debuts from PUBG-developer Krafton Inc. to Kakao Pay. “South Korea could be one of the many markets that are diversifying Softbank’s geographic exposure,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anthea Lai. “The country’s advance in mobile connectivity definitely helps strengthen SVF’s investment thesis there.” Shares of Yanolja’s investor SBI Investment Korea Co. soared 13% in Seoul, while another investor, AJU IB Investment Co., gained 5.3%. Yanolja, founded by former motel manager Lee Su-jin in 2005 originally as a short-stay hotel-booking service, is hoping to tap resurgent interest in Korea’s tech scene. SoftBank’s Vision Fund invested $2.7 billion in Coupang and the value of that stake in the e-commerce company grew more than 10 times to $28 billion at the end of March after the IPO. Yanolja has considered a dual listing in Seoul and overseas, Bloomberg News has reported. It announced in November it’s selected Mirae Asset Daewoo Co. as a lead arranger along with Samsung Securities Co. as a co-underwriter with a goal to go public this year. The startup, which is also the world’s largest property management software provider after Oracle Corp., is still exploring options and the size and location of its IPO haven’t been finalized. Backed by Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte and Booking Holdings Inc., Yanolja has been expanding its business to include leisure activities and transport along with hotel bookings. With its acquisition of Indian lodgings management platform eZee Technosys in 2019, the startup says it is now the world’s largest cloud-based hotel management solution provider. Despite Covid-19 lockdowns, it reported a 44% increase in sales and a 16.1 billion won profit for 2020."

Introduced nearly 50 years ago, air miles are a way for the industry to make money. Aside from locking in repeat customers by helping them accumulate trips, airlines sell miles to credit-card companies, banks, hotels and other businesses for billions of dollars. This revenue source is crucial now that the pandemic has thrown aviation into crisis, and airlines are piling in with new offers such as bonus points and lowering thresholds to qualify for more perks. Some are also increasing the number of points members earn from shopping, as well as expanding partnerships so there are more opportunities to rack up miles. That means it should take less effort to secure reward flights or upgrade to business class. Delta Air Lines Inc. is providing four times the usual amount of miles for purchases with American Express cards at U.S. supermarkets, while Etihad Airways PJSC is offering up to $400 and 5,000 miles for passengers who postpone flights scheduled before July 31 and has points deals for online shopping and cash-back offers with brands including KFC and Pizza Hut. “These programs appeal to a carrier’s very best revenue-producing customers, so there is abundant need to keep these consumers happy,” said Jay Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive who is now president of consultancy IdeaWorksCompany. “In the near term, consumers will see a windfall of cheap travel for redeeming points or miles.” We're automatically renewing all #MarcoPoloClub memberships and unused mid-tier benefits set to expire between May 2020 and April 2021 for another 12 months, so you can enjoy them when you travel again. We look forward to seeing you onboard soon.https://t.co/awyPdmMagj T&Cs apply pic.twitter.com/pk0bRBTZyK According to a 2017 study by Stifel Financial Corp., airlines can get up to 2.5 cents for every mile, so they are a rich source of liquidity. Banks then benefit from annual charges on credit cards and merchant fees when cards are used. JetBlue Airways Corp. this month sold loyalty points to Barclays Plc for $150 million. The airline received $475 million from such deals in 2019, according to Stifel analyst Joe DeNardi. American Airlines Group Inc. got $4.3 billion and Delta reaped $4.2 billion last year, he said. American Airlines said Tuesday its AAdvantage loyalty program -- “the biggest asset we have in the company” -- has a value of as much $30 billion, and that it is negotiating with the U.S. Treasury Department to use at least part of it as collateral for a multibillion dollar loan. Bloomberg News reported in April that the Treasury Department was in talks with some carriers about accepting loyalty programs as collateral as they rushed to raise funds. Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., which flew just 458 passengers a day in April, is extending Marco Polo memberships and unused mid-tier benefits -- access to business-class lounges, for example -- by 12 months. United Airlines Holdings Inc. has extended Premier memberships through 2022 and made it easier to qualify for reward flights and earn points. Emirates Airline is letting elite Skywards members maintain their statuses by fulfilling just 70% of their tier travel requirements, as well as giving 20% bonus tier miles. This comes as the world’s biggest long-haul carrier considers thousands of job cuts. “It’s a good thing for consumers and for the airlines,” said Steve Saxon, a Shanghai-based partner at McKinsey & Co. “Being able to earn miles for everyday spending makes flight redemptions much more accessible” and carriers can get revenue for seats that might otherwise go empty, he said. Emirates’ members account for almost 45% of the carrier’s commercial revenue, according to Nejib Ben Khedher, divisional senior vice president of Emirates Skywards. Abu Dhabi’s Etihad says loyalty programs help it “obtain valuable data on each guest which allows us to tailor their experience,” while Singapore Airlines Ltd. does “not take their loyalty for granted.” Singapore Airlines last week reported a record loss. Qatar Airways is offering a so-called status-match with some airlines, and planning new banking and hotel partners. Cheap offers will extend until the end of 2020 for domestic routes and through next spring for longer-haul international routes, Sorensen said. Some airlines may cut down non-travel awards to save cash, or offer discounted business-class seats to loyalty members as companies reduce premium travel, he said. “Loyalty programs will play an essential role in the industry’s recovery by creating incentives for customers to restart traveling,” said Renato Ramos, director for loyalty at Star Alliance, a grouping of airlines that includes the likes of Air China Ltd., Deutsche Lufthansa AG and United. “In addition to the existing perks for frequent fliers, we are looking at ways to find new benefits.” One risk is there’s little value left in miles or co-branded credit cards if the issuing airline collapses, which is a very real threat as the likes of Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd., Avianca Holdings SA and others show. “The airline industry itself, among them the legacy airlines, will be transformed after this earthquake-like shock,” said Pankaj Pandit, an independent consultant based in the Indian city of Bengaluru, formerly known as Bangalore. “Many legacy airlines may simply vanish, so naturally their appendage, the loyalty programs, will also wither away,” he said in an email. Some are trying to incentivize members to spend on associated credit cards and transfer points in from other partners such as hotels, according to Gary Leff, co-founder of InsideFlyer.com who writes on loyalty programs. “There will be empty seats to fill and airlines will need to rely on their programs to make generous offers in order to bring back consumers,” Leff said. “Expect loyalty programs to run aggressive promotions, travel businesses to spend heavily marketing to their frequent fliers and frequent stay guests. In addition, with all of this excess inventory it’ll be easier for consumers to use their points. This will last as long as the downturn lasts.”"

The offering consists of 15 million shares to be sold by the company and 15 million by existing stockholders, Frontier said in a statement Tuesday. The shares are expected to list on the Nasdaq stock market, under the ticker symbol ULCC -- the industry’s acronym for ultra-low-cost carrier. The sale will be the second U.S. airline IPO this year, following Sun Country Airlines Holdings Inc.’s on March 17. Through Monday, Sun Country had jumped 47% from its offering price. Frontier dropped plans for an IPO last July after the coronavirus pandemic decimated demand for air travel. Both discount carriers are banking on a wave of leisure trips as more people are vaccinated against Covid-19 and case growth slows. Frontier also expects that more Americans will take short trips as they work outside their offices, the carrier said in a regulatory filing. “We plan to strategically deploy our capacity where demand is highest during the recovery,” the filing said. “More broadly, after being restricted from travel, we believe many customers will take advantage of the opportunity to travel more in the coming years.” The carrier, which operates as Frontier Airlines, is based in Denver, where it faces competition from United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. Frontier’s fleet of 104 jets in the Airbus SE A320 family serve 110 airports in the U.S. and other destinations in the Americas. The carrier is led by Chief Executive Officer Barry Biffle and Chairman William Franke, who has established discount airlines including Spirit Airlines Inc. in the U.S., Mexico’s Volaris, Chile’s JetSmart Airlines SpA, Hungary’s Wizz Air Holdings Plc and Singapore’s Tiger Airways Holdings Pte. His investment firm Indigo Partners LLC acquired Frontier in December 2013. Frontier won’t receive proceeds from the sale by existing holders, one of which intends to grant underwriters a 30-day option to buy an additional 4.5 million shares, according to the statement. The company didn’t identify the seller. The IPO’s underwriters include Citigroup Inc., Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, Morgan Stanley and Evercore ISI."

Officials expect the new policy to be signed off by government in the next few days, paving the way for the reopening of international journeys to popular destinations in Europe and the U.S. on Britain’s so-called amber list of medium-risk countries. The aviation and tourism industry has been hammered since the start of the pandemic, after governments were forced to close down international leisure travel to try to stop passengers importing the virus. With the European Union now moving to ease border restrictions, calls for the U.K. to follow suit have grown increasingly urgent. Ryanair Holdings Plc and the owner of Manchester and Stansted airports filed a court challenge to the U.K. rules last week, saying a lack of transparency on how the government assesses risk levels is undermining consumer confidence. On Wednesday, industry groups organized a protest to underscore demands that include targeted aid, amid warnings that up to 218,000 jobs are at risk from the ongoing restrictions. About 800 people --  including baggage handlers, travel agents and pilots grouped into two batches for social distancing -- gathered outside Parliament to demand a travel restart to save jobs. “We keep hearing optimistic noises from the government but we don’t see any action,” said Brian Strutton, acting general secretary of the Balpa pilots union. “There’s a change of direction every day and that’s left the industry confused and angry.” The U.K. currently codes foreign destinations in a so-called traffic light system based on assessments of pandemic risk, including vaccination and infection rates. The safest countries are on the “green list,” and passengers arriving in England from them do not need to quarantine. People arriving from 167 destinations on the amber list are required to quarantine at home for 10 days and take tests after arriving, while those landing from red list countries -- rated the worst-hit by Covid -- must quarantine in a hotel. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is expected to publish an update to the lists on Thursday, though officials do not expect him to announce any major expansion of the list of safest countries. The government is also due to give an update on rule changes, including exemptions for people who have been fully vaccinated, and this could also come on Thursday or on June 28, officials said. U.K. Covid Data Looking Good for Lifting Curbs, Johnson Says Johnson said Monday ministers will be examining how to give more freedom to vaccinated travelers, but warned “this is going to be, whatever happens, a difficult year for travel” with disruption and delays likely to continue. “The priority has got to be keeping the country safe and to stop the virus coming back in,” he said. But the change is unlikely to come into force before August, and ministers are expected to keep a tight limit on the number of destinations on the so-called green list for quarantine-free travel when they provide an update this week. This may minimize the benefit to airlines such as EasyJet Plc and British Airways, which have stepped up demands to loosen border restrictions with vaccines now having reached 65% of the U.K. population. Final decisions on the quarantine policy and the green list have not yet been taken inside government, and both will be subject to scientific advice on the status of the pandemic. “The whole point of the vaccine program is to be able to remove restrictions,” Health Secretary Matt Hancock told LBC radio on Tuesday. “We are working on a plan for double vaccinated people, using tests and to have that testing regime in place instead of having to have the quarantine in some circumstances.”"

The national task force will meet on Friday to decide on Health Ministry’s proposals for stay-at-home orders and a ban on travel between provinces for two weeks, Permanent Secretary of Public Health Kiattiphum Wongrajit told reporters on Thursday. While essential businesses and services such as food markets and hospitals may be allowed to operate, people will be barred from traveling for non-essential activities, he said. The proposed curbs are similar to a national lockdown last year when all the non-essential businesses were closed and a ban on social gatherings and local travel was in force for about a month, according to Kiattiphum. The partial lockdown may cover the greater Bangkok area -- home to more than 10 million people and contributing about 45% to the nation’s gross domestic product -- and some provinces with high Covid cases, he said. The push for tighter containment measures follows a 10-fold surge in infections since early April that threatened to derail Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha’s pledge to fully reopen the country in about 100 days. Health experts had called for strict containment measures, saying the more contagious delta variant would cause a spike in infections and deaths amid a low rate of vaccinations. Airport workers wait in line to receive Covid-19 vaccinations at the Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok on June 30. Thailand, the first country outside China to report a Covid infection, has struggled to stem the pandemic after its initial success to combat the virus last year, when it imposed a hard lockdown. But that crippled its all-important tourism industry and plunged the economy into its worst performance in more than two decades. Prayuth, who had previously been reluctant to impose a lockdown to avoid further damage to jobs and industries, said on Thursday there’s a need for disease control measures that may affect daily lives. “If we do nothing, the situation may get worse,” Prayuth said in a post on Facebook. “We may need to impose more stringent measures to limit mobility, prevent group activities, and close more businesses and activities.” With the delta variant, first detected in India, now sweeping through the region, there’s growing pressure on leaders like Prayuth and Indonesian President Joko Widodo to impose tighter measures. Any further dithering may lead to the crisis worsening in Thailand, according to Anan Jongkaewwattana, an expert in molecular virology and director of the research unit at the National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology. “A strict lockdown is the only way out,” Bangkok-based Anan said before the health ministry proposed tighter curbs. “It might hurt the economy now, but things will be better in the long run once we can contain the spread.” Prayuth set a 120-day deadline last month to fully open Thailand to vaccinated foreign visitors, which he said was a calculated risk to reduce “the enormous suffering of people who have lost their ability to earn an income.” He wants the tourism industry, which contributed about 20% to GDP pre-pandemic, to hum again. That has meant allowing many businesses to operate normally in Bangkok and nearby provinces even though they are the hotspots of the current Covid wave. Although Prayuth has ordered restrictions for restaurants and construction work, the outbreak has raged on with daily cases averaging more than 5,000 in the past week. On Thursday, the nation added 7,058 new cases and 75 deaths, a new daily record. “If this situation continues, the Thai outbreak will be worse than Indonesia’s on a per-capita basis, with as many as 20,000 cases per day in the next few months,” Anan said. “Infections aren’t just limited to construction camps and crowded communities -- it’s more widespread than that so current restrictions aren’t enough.” A slow vaccination drive, that relies mostly on shots from AstraZeneca Plc and China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd., has hampered efforts to contain the virus spread. Thailand has administered about 11.3 million shots, enough to cover about 8% of its population, ranking the country behind more than 120 other nations in vaccination rate. More Than 3.32 Billion Shots Given: Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker The worsening outbreak has also hurt investor confidence with the nation’s equities and currency both bearing the brunt. The baht fell to a fresh 14-month low against the dollar on Thursday, while the SET index of stocks tumbled 2.1% to close at its lowest level since April 12. The gauge has dropped 5.5% from a 19-month high reached in mid-June after foreign investors turned net sellers of $1.48 billion of stocks in the second quarter. Koraphat Vorachet, a strategist at Bangkok-based Capital Nomura Securities Pcl, is advising clients to be selective in their investments given uncertainties stemming from the pandemic. The Phuket model of reopening needs to be watched closely as a major Covid outbreak in that resort island would lead to a suspension of activities and delay any recovery, he said. Thai companies are also wary of a hurried reopening without fully controlling the outbreak. A majority of the chief executives surveyed by the Federation of Thai Industries want the government to reopen the country only when new infections are down significantly. Thailand’s economic recovery will be hampered given the slow vaccine rollout, ineffectiveness of some jabs against the delta variant and its quick spread, according to Somprawin Manprasert, chief economist at Bangkok-based Bank of Ayudhya Pcl’s research unit. Fiscal and monetary policies must be direct and targeted at those most affected by the pandemic, he said. “Evidence suggests that the infections are already widespread, and current restrictions won’t help contain the outbreak,” Anan said. “If we don’t tighten restrictions, the infection rate will rise exponentially.”"

State-owned Qatar Airways consolidated its position as the world’s biggest freight carrier among passenger operators last year after keeping routes open during lockdowns to service trade flows, adding new destinations and converting some planes for cargo-only operations. Bloomberg reported in June that Airbus is close to taking orders for the A350F if it can line up the commitments. The plane would provide the Toulouse, France-based company with a contender in a market dominated by Boeing. But Al Baker said an Airbus order would require a resolution to issues with the passenger version of the jet. Qatar Airways has said paint on some A350s is degrading faster than it should and that the issue must be fixed before it will take more deliveries. Asked about the new 777X passenger plane, for which Qatar Airways is the launch customer, Al Baker said he is “very excited” about the model and that once Boeing launches a freighter variant, “we will be giving them the opportunity, together with Airbus freighters.” On the A350 he cautioned: “That is, if Airbus resolves our issues very quickly.” Al Baker said last month that Qatar Airways is “really hungry for more freighters” but can’t obtain the current 777F, which is based on Boeing’s existing 777 model, until 2023. The Doha-based company ranked second only to FedEx Corp. in 2019 by freight ton kilometers, putting it ahead of United Parcel Service Inc. and traditional cargo heavyweights Korean Air Lines Co., Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. and Deutsche Lufthansa AG, as well as local rival Emirates. Al Baker’s interview will air on Wednesday. The event is hosted by Inmarsat Aviation and aviation trade group APEX. The Gulf carrier could place a “large customer order” for an A350 freighter planned by European manufacturer Airbus or a new 777F from its U.S. rival before the end of the third quarter, Al Baker told the FlightPlan III webinar. Al Baker has lobbied for the aircraft before, but neither planemaker has committed to making a freighter version of the passenger jumbo-jets. His urgency highlights how important burgeoning cargo demand has become to airlines whose long-haul passenger markets remain blighted by the coronavirus crisis."

But even as vaccine rollouts gather pace, a return to a pre-pandemic normal could be years away as many countries take a go-slow approach to reopening. That’s a daunting prospect for executives like Sammy Tsui. The founder of China Tech Global, a company that sells sanitizing equipment, says the inability to travel has translated into stalled and lost deals as potential clients aren’t able to test out products such as walk-through sanitation tunnels and thermal devices. Among the deals he’s waiting to close is a HK$200 million ($21.2 million) contract with a Qatari client who is interested in using the equipment during next year’s soccer World Cup in the Gulf state, but with whom he has only been able to talk to over Zoom. “If I could have traveled in the past six months I would have sealed a lot of substantial contracts,” Tsui said from Hong Kong, where an unusually strict hotel quarantine period of 21 days for anyone coming from outside China has all but put a stop to non-essential travel. Research last year by the Growth Lab at Harvard University’s Center for International Development found a direct link between incoming business travel and the growth of industry. The ability to swap know-how facilitated by such travel is crucial to economic growth, they found. The business travel freeze is compounding the economic hit from the choke in international tourism. According to the United Nations’s World Tourism Agency in January, up to 120 million jobs, mostly in small and medium-sized businesses, are at risk. Bloomberg Economics estimates that the Philippines, Thailand, Mexico, Spain and Italy face the biggest hit. That’s prompted the International Monetary Fund to warn that trade in services will recover more slowly than merchandise volumes, even as vaccinations help the global economy rebound this year at the fastest pace since 2007, spurred by trade and manufacturing. WATCH: Digital Covid-19 vaccine passports are being touted by some political and business leaders as a way to revive international travel and hospitality. Source: Quicktake The diverging pace of vaccine distribution between advanced and developing economies will mean only a gradual recovery in business travel over several years, with the resumption of critical services -- such as machine repairs and audits -- returning faster than other activities such as conferences, according to Ricardo Hausmann, a professor of international political economy at Harvard who worked on the Growth Lab paper alongside researchers Michele Coscia and Frank Neffke. “I think this will translate into a productivity slowdown for the world,” Hausmann said. There’s been little major progress on easing travel restrictions since the year began, with quarantines and other curbs extended or tightened from the U.S. and Western Europe to New Zealand and Hong Kong. A proposal by the International Air Transport Association for test or vaccine certificates to replace quarantines hasn’t gained traction with governments. Travel bubbles and digital health passports are other options that have been floated. Even in countries where the virus has been quashed, cross-border travel has proven difficult to restart as governments are reluctant to drop mandatory quarantines as the front line in their fight against Covid-19. Some Asian countries are willing to shorten their quarantine periods, however, for business travelers. Singapore has started taking applications for a program that will allow people to enter for business and official purposes without having to quarantine for 14 days -- but they will need to stay in a bubble-like facility near Changi Airport. Plans for the city-state to host the World Economic Forum’s Special Annual Meeting have already been pushed back from May to August. Taiwan plans to allow shorter quarantines for business travelers provided they meet a host of conditions starting in March. Health workers wait to screen arriving passengers at Vancouver International Airport in Canada on Feb. 22. Shorter travel turnarounds will become easier as low-cost, high-efficacy tests are made more available, according to Gloria Guevara, head of the World Travel & Tourism Council. But a full reopening will only be possible with mass vaccinations on a global scale. “All countries need to realize that they cannot get out of this alone,” said Karen A. Grépin, associate professor at the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health. “We need higher levels of global cooperation to get us out of this predicament.” For now, executives like Hong Kong-based Stefan Kracht, who advises and offers services to medium-sized European companies with operations in China, have put their frequent-flier lifestyles on hold. Online meetings, he said, have been effective in “continuing relations” with existing clients. Before the pandemic, Kracht, managing director of Fiducia Management Consultants, was a frequent traveler to mainland China and to Europe. Without physical contact, he said, “the biggest challenge is winning new clients.”"

The U.S.’s rolling one-week average of new virus cases fell to the lowest level since June. United Food and Commercial Workers, the union that represents more than 1 million food and retail employees, criticized the CDC’s guidance last week saying fully vaccinated people could mostly stop wearing masks.

Subscribe to a daily update on the virus from Bloomberg’s Prognosis team here. Click CVID on the terminal for global data on cases and deaths. United Food and Commercial Workers, the union that represents more than 1 million food and retail employees, praised the governors of New Jersey and Hawaii for maintaining stricter indoor mask rules. The union criticized guidance last week from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying fully vaccinated people could mostly stop wearing masks, though those rules can be overridden by localities. Union President Marc Perrone said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and Hawaii Governor David Ige “are doing the right thing by keeping these life-saving mask mandates in place.” The union said that 462 frontline workers in the U.S., including in grocery stores and meatpacking plants, have died of Covid-19 and more than 93,000 were infected. California’s deaths doubled to 55 from 27 the day before, with the fatalities still low at 0.1 deaths for every 100,000, based on the state’s seven-day average. The positive test rate dipped slightly to 1%, the health department’s website said. The state reported 1,370 Covid-19 cases yesterday, a rate of 3.3 new cases per 100,000, a decrease from the day before. California has administered more than 34.4 million vaccines in total. Singapore may be facing slower vaccine deliveries over the next couple of months, as the country considers delaying second shots. Ho Ching, the wife of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, cited the scarcity in a Facebook post Sunday. “Yes, our vaccine deliveries are slow this month and possibly next 1-2 months,” said Ho, who is also the outgoing CEO of Singapore’s state-owned investor Temasek Holdings Pte. New Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said the government is studying holding off the second shots in order to give more people at least one vaccine dose. “There have been many international studies and it shows that even with one dose, it confers good protection without compromising efficacy,” Ong said. “Our scientists have been studying this.” Italy recorded 93 coronavirus deaths on Sunday, the lowest count since late October. New infections were 5,753, close to the seven-month low registered last week. Italy has been accelerating its vaccination campaign to over 500,000 shots per day, and infections have continued falling even with the loosening of restrictions on the economy and social life. Any mandates in the U.S. to require people to be vaccinated against Covid-19 will be set at the local level by companies and institutions such as colleges, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. “It may very well be that local businesses, local jurisdictions, will work towards vaccine mandates,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “That is going to be locally driven and not federally driven.” Separately, on “Fox News Sunday,” Walensky cited colleges or universities that may enforce vaccine mandates for students, and that the cruise ship industry may also consider it for people about to embark on multiday journeys at sea. Walensky spoke days after the CDC announced that Americans vaccinated against Covid-19 were clear to shed their face masks in public at most times. More than 20 million people, or 38% of the British adult population, are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, the government said Sunday. Over 36.5 million, or 69%, have had one dose. The U.K. will open inoculations to everyone 35 and older this week as it combats cases of a highly transmissible variant that originated in India. The country reported another 1,926 cases and four deaths on Sunday. Both figures are up about 9% over the last seven days. Hong Kong will increase restrictions on arrivals from Taiwan and Singapore, the South China Morning Post reports. Taiwan, Singapore and Japan are to be classified high risk according to the city’s vaccine bubble travel arrangements. Unvaccinated travelers arriving from those places will have to quarantine at designated hotels for 21 days as well as present proof of a negative test. All primary, secondary, junior college and Millennia Institute students will shift to full home-based learning from May 19 till the end of the school term on May 28, Singapore’s Ministry of Education said on Sunday. Preschools and student care centers remain open to support parents who have to work. Ireland’s Department of Health has been hit by a cyber attack similar to the ransomware one carried out last week on the country’s Health Service Executive, RTE News said on Sunday. Covid-19 vaccination appointments and testing are underway, but there may be some delays in getting results back, the HSE said. Contact tracing is also operating, though it may take longer than usual, it said. The U.S. added slightly more than 30,000 cases on Saturday, sending the nation’s rolling one-week average to the lowest level since late last June, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg. Even so, another 480 people died of illness related to Covid-19. That compares with peaks of more than 5,000 deaths a day in January and February. Amazon.com Inc. and Indian renewable energy company Greenko Group are boosting supplies of oxygen concentrators to the country. The U.S. company is working with “sellers on its marketplace to help them bring in about 9,000 oxygen concentrators for customers in India,” it wrote in a blog on Saturday. The first batch of 1,000 oxygen concentrators have landed and are available for purchase while the rest are expected in the second half of May, it said. Turkey will ease its virus restrictions from Monday as new cases of Covid-19 decline following a three-week lockdown, offering a glimmer of hope for the summer tourist season. Infections plummeted to 11,472 on Saturday from a record high of 63,082 a month ago, though that’s still above the target of no more than 5,000 cases set by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan when he announced the national lockdown from April 29. Most travel restrictions will be lifted but nighttime and weekend curfews will remain in place, and restaurants will only open for food deliveries, according to an Interior Ministry decree on Sunday. Germany’s contagion rate fell further below a key level, a trend that could trigger a loosening of some pandemic restrictions. Infections dropped to 83.1 per 100,000 people over the past seven days, according to the RKI public-health institute. The incidence rate dipped under 100 on Friday and regional governments can start to lift restrictions if it remains below that level for five consecutive working days. Taiwan registered a record 206 new local cases on Sunday, after adding 180 infections the previous day. The country is racing to contain its worst outbreak of the coronavirus, while averting a full lockdown. Covid-19 vaccines are highly effective even after the first dose, according to a large-scale study by Italy’s national health institute. Infections, hospitalizations and deaths all declined significantly about 14 days after the first shot. After 35 days, infections were 80% lower than among those who hadn’t received any dose, while hospitalizations were 90% lower and deaths 95% lower. More than 7 million Italians who had received at least one vaccine dose between Dec. 27 and April 4 were surveyed. Two-thirds were given the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine, while 29% received AstraZeneca Plc’s shot. A cyclone is set to hit the western coast of India -- the country’s industrialized belt with big refineries and ports -- prompting authorities already grappling with a deadly second virus wave to start preparations for evacuating citizens. Cyclone “Tauktae,” currently about 500 kilometers (310 miles) from the financial hub of Mumbai, is expected to make landfall Tuesday morning in the southern districts of Gujarat, with wind speeds touching 175 kilometers per hour, according to the India Meteorological Department. It has intensified into a “very severe cyclonic storm,” the national weather forecaster said in a tweet Sunday. Local authorities in Mumbai have already moved hundreds of Covid-19 patients to other facilities. Prime Minister Narendra Modi told senior government officials to ensure “maintenance of all essential services such as power, telecommunications, health and drinking water,” according to a May 15 statement from Press Information Bureau. India reported 311,170 new infections Sunday, continuing the downward trajectory seen in the past few days, bolstering hopes that cases may have peaked after a deadly second wave that overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums. The case tally has crossed 24.6 million, according to the India’s health ministry. More than 182 million vaccine doses have been administered. While the daily surge in cases is ebbing, there’s no let up in deaths with the Asian nation reporting 4,077 more casualties, pushing the total to 270,284. Those death toll numbers might be understated, according to local media reports of bodies floating along river banks in the northern states. The Dainik Bhaskar, a Hindi newspaper popular across India’s crowded heartland, fanned 30 of its reporters along the banks of the river Ganga in Uttar Pradesh state. They found -- and photographed -- more than 2,000 corpses across some 1,140 kilometers (708 miles). The state government claims only about 300 are dying daily. Their findings make grim reading: authorities are piling silt over more than 350 bodies lying in shallow graves in Kannauj, the reporters say; they see dogs gnawing at some of the 400 corpses just a short distance from a crematorium in Kanpur; they count 52 corpses floating down the river in Ghazipur, often crossing state borders. Singapore plans to vaccinate under 16 year-olds after a recent rise of Covid-19 infections among students in the island state, according to Education Minister Chan Chun Sing. The ministries of education and health are working out plans for the “vaccination of our students,” Chan wrote on his Facebook page. “Once the approval for use is granted, we will roll out vaccinations to those below 16.” Global Tracker: Cases pass 162.6 million; deaths exceed 3.37 million Vaccine Tracker: More than 1.45 billion doses have been given Small town reporters reveal coronavirus carnage in India CDC’s big mask change went from science to secret to surprise There’s no hidden U.S. vaccine stockpile ready to send abroad Asia’s Covid success stories, Taiwan and Singapore, face threats"

Turkish Airlines decided to increase staff wages in July as the easing of coronavirus restrictions in many countries raised hopes for a quicker recovery in aviation. The salaries of both domestic and foreign personnel working on the reopened international routes have been raised by a minimum of 10% above inflation, the airline said in a statement. The company cited global loosening of restrictions and the cautious optimism over vaccination programs, while also taking into account sacrifices made by employees during the pandemic. Turkish Airlines is one of the first major carriers to post a profit this year after a boost in freight revenue. The company announced first quarter net income of $50.5 million, or 438 million liras, even as sales declined, reversing a year-earlier loss and beating analyst estimates. Last year, the company put foreign national pilots on unpaid leave to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its finances."

She spoke hours after Catalan officials announced plans to slap a 10-person limit on social gatherings and order all non-essential activity to end at 12:30 a.m. as the region takes fresh steps to rein in a jump in infections. With other regions including Valencia also imposing new restrictions, France and Germany are among countries that have highlighted the risks of holidaying in Spain with Covid-19 cases on the rise again.

Prices in New York slid 0.8% on Thursday, the biggest decline in two weeks, after rising for eight straight sessions. The IEA said the re-balancing of the global oil markets remains “fragile” and slashed its forecasts for world oil consumption in 2021 as the pandemic continues to limit travel and economic activity. Still, the agency said the market’s prospects look stronger in the second half of the year, and swollen oil inventories will drop sharply as fuel use picks up. “Crude has shown some really strong gains,” said Gary Cunningham, director at Stamford, Connecticut-based Tradition Energy. But “there’s some questions as to whether or not these levels can be maintained” amid uncertainty over the demand recovery and the ability for producers to limit supplies. While crude is up more than 11% this month, the recent stretch of price gains had pushed its 14-day Relative Strength Index this week to the most overbought level since 1999, signaling the rally was due for a correction. But the underlying setup for oil remains firm. Citigroup Inc. predicted the global benchmark Brent will likely reach $70 a barrel by the end of the year, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. called a new supercycle for commodities. Oil’s rebound accelerated after Saudi Arabia pledged to deepen output cuts and the premium on the nearest contract firmed in a bullish backwardation structure, helping to unwind global stockpiles built up during the outbreak. There are still concerns that the virus may curb near-term fuel demand, with China’s air traffic falling sharply ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday after a resurgence in some areas. “It’s an ideal time for profit-taking” following the recent streak of price gains, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. Yet, “there’s optimism that a lot of Americans are going to get vaccinated in these next couple months, which means they’re going to be more willing to travel.” Along with the IEA’s expectation for a brighter second half of the year, OPEC also said demand for its crude will be higher than previously expected, on a weaker outlook for rival supply and stronger global consumption in the second half. “We’re seeing that the outlook for the economy and oil demand in 2021 is looking brighter, despite the near-term weakness because of coronavirus,” Toril Bosoni, head of the oil market division at the IEA said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “We still have to reduce the overhang on the product stocks that built up.” Meanwhile, the recent rise in oil prices is draining oil storage locations across the Americas. With the market in backwardation, storage has become unprofitable, and U.S. Gulf Coast terminal operators are now offering to lease tanks at less than half the rate at the height of the storage boom last year. West Texas Intermediate for March delivery fell 44 cents to settle at $58.24 a barrel Brent for April settlement slid 33 cents to end the session at $61.14 a barrel, posting the largest daily loss since Jan. 22 The polar blast freezing much of the U.S. is driving up demand for heating oil, a boon for a crude market that until now has relied on freight to make up for the pandemic’s devastating impact on driving and air travel. Libya’s Hariga port has reopened after guards ended their strike that blocked oil exports from the eastern terminal. Royal Dutch Shell said its carbon emissions and oil production have peaked and will decline in the coming years as the company laid out a detailed plan for its transition to cleaner energy. Oil union SAFE has notified the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association that it will take out 12 members at Equinor’s Mongstad refinery in a strike if a wage deal isn’t reached by midnight Monday, union says in emailed statement."

Starting this month, CSC Financial Co. managing directors’ domestic travel will be downgraded to economy flights and second class or hard-berth train seats, according to a memo seen by Bloomberg. Larger rival Citic Securities Co. also asked managing directors to fly coach, according to a separate memo, which did not specify which class of travel they were previously offered. Spokespeople for Citic Securities and CSC Financial didn’t immediately reply to emails seeking comment. The cuts are another example of how policy makers are pressuring the nation’s biggest state-owned financial groups to reduce salaries and costs to support China’s recovery from the pandemic. Financial firms were given details on how to limit pay at the beginning of last year by the Ministry of Finance and entities including China’s massive sovereign wealth fund and its biggest bank were affected, people with knowledge of the matter have said. CSC Financial’s Chairman Wang Changqing will travel first class instead of the more expensive business by train, according to the broker’s memo. Commuting costs in and out of airports will no longer be reimbursed as expenses but include a transportation allowance of 80 yuan ($12) per day, according to memos from both institutions. A one-way taxi ride from the Shanghai Pudong International Airport to the Lujiazui Financial District costs about 200 yuan. While the cuts won’t stop executives traveling, they may dampen morale among bankers used to more attractive perks. Citic Securities also cut daily hotel allowances for non-executive bankers by 200 yuan to 700 yuan per day in major cities from Beijing to Shanghai, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Bankers are encouraged to share rooms, according to CSC Financial’s memo. Should they do so, they can spend 50% more than the daily allowance for a single banker, compared with the the 30% limit previously in place. While bankers can pay for upgrades out of their own pocket, they were strongly discouraged from doing so, the memo said. Globally, banks are reassessing the need for travel and debating the extent of remote work. HSBC Holdings Plc is budgeting for travel costs to fall by half, with greater reliance on video technology and having people go on fewer, longer trips when they do travel. Standard Chartered Plc is also expecting travel costs to reduce sharply. Citic Group Corp., the parent company of Citic Securities, is seeking to broaden income sources and reduce expenditures, which the group’s vice-chairman Xi Guohua said last year will help deal with market uncertainty and boost growth. Total assets at Citic Securities, China’s biggest broker, surpassed 1 trillion yuan for the first time last year while return on equity of 8.68% still lagged Wall Street banks. At CSC Financial, in which Citic Securities held a 4.94% stake, profit declined 12% in the first quarter."

And few people are happy about it.  Royal Caribbean’s 4,275-passenger Freedom of the Seas has restarted sailings from Miami to the Bahamas with two classes of passengers on board—those who’ve been vaccinated against Covid-19, and those who have not. Jabbed guests, identified with special wristbands, get full run of the ship; those unprotected from the virus won’t even be able to walk into the sushi bar, casino, or spa.  Freedom is the first ship to depart the U.S. without a vaccination requirement, and it’s also the first to depart from the nation’s cruise capital of Miami. For all the city’s influence on the cruising industry, it’s also proved to be  a difficult place to restart business, given that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has  barred businesses from requiring vaccine cards. “The cruise experience benefits from being impromptu,” says Jukka Laitamaki, a tourism marketing expert and professor at the NYU School of Professional Studies Jonathan M. Tisch Center of Hospitality. Cruisers are typically free to hang out where they want, do what they want to do, and make friends. But unvaccinated cruisers on Freedom will find much of that restricted. “It is the cruise lines’ worst nightmare to have to have separate areas for the vaccinated and unvaccinated,” Laitamaki says. The system has proved necessary. Even on cruises with strict Covid-19 vaccine requirements for adults, issues have already cropped up. In late June, Royal had to pay to repatriate two unvaccinated teenagers who tested positive—and their families—from the Bahamas. Sister line Celebrity also had an incident of two asymptomatic guests testing positive on a sailing from St. Maarten. (Remember, you can still carry the coronavirus  even when vaccinated.)  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s rules for cruise companies require lines to enforce mask-wearing and social distancing when unvaccinated cruisers are on board. But companies have some discretion about the finer points. Royal Caribbean’s list of restrictions for Freedom, issued in mid-June, is a long one. It applies to all sailings on the ship in July—and likely to four other ships the line plans to launch from Florida this summer, with capacities of up to 6,680 passengers. Those with a hole punched in their SeaPass—indicating that they haven’t been jabbed or declined to show a vaccine card—will be segregated to one deck of the main dining room and will be banned from some of the better, more intimate for-a-fee dining venues. (That includes families with unvaccinated kids, too, so long as they’re sticking together.) Off limits will be the popular maritime-themed Schooner Bar pub and Viking Crown nightclub, the casino, art auctions, and the indoor Solarium pool and bar. Gatherings such as the 1970s-themed party will be open only to vaccinated guests. If you aren’t immunized and want to see a show, you’ll sit in a segregated area in the back of the theater. And you can only use the gym during specified hours. At least for now, mask wearing is required indoors (but not outdoors) of everyone on board Freedom when not eating or drinking—though some venues that are only open to vaccinated guests will be able to nix the rule.   The trip will cost more for unvaccinated guests, too. Anyone over the age of 12 who doesn’t voluntarily show proof of vaccine will have to provide a negative result from a Covid-19 PCR test taken within three days of departure. They’ll also have to pay for a second test at the pier and a third upon disembarking on the last day—totaling $136 or $178 per person, depending on the sailing.   In addition, Royal is requiring unvaccinated travelers leaving from Florida to purchase  travel insurance—at least $25,000 per person for medical expense coverage and $50,000 per person for medical evacuation—from Aug. 1 through the end of 2021. On a one-week cruise, this can add $200 or more to the combined fare of an unvaccinated family of four. And that’s just on the ship. Each port of call has its own constantly changing rules, some requiring guests without immunity to stay on board or limit themselves to select shore excursions. For cruise lines, which have  already lost billions of dollars in the pandemic and are just getting back to business, the two-class system may have an impact on the revenue stream. Onboard spending accounted for 28.3% of Royal Caribbean’s total revenue in 2019, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Brian Egger. If there are many unvaccinated passengers, those figures may end up suppressed. So far that’s not the case. Only 7% of the passengers on the first Freedom cruise are unvaccinated, and most are kids. At that rate, onboard spending losses may tap out at about $50,000—a drop in the bucket on a ship that, say, rakes in $1.5 million per trip. Mark Tamis, senior vice president of hotel operations for Royal, said lost revenue didn’t even enter into the equation. But the line is currently only sailing at 40% capacity to allow for social distancing and put new health protocols to the test—with plans to ramp up capacity throughout the summer. What’s more, immunized guests may not want to co-mingle with the un-jabbed, potentially hampering ticket sales or driving cancellations, which have been high since Royal announced its protocol. “The people who are not vaccinated don’t want restrictions,” says Mindy Breitman, a travel adviser with Cruise Planners, who has been busy fielding cancellation requests. “And the people who are vaccinated don’t want to wear masks because of the non-vaxed on board,” she says. Both cruisers and cruise executives agree that a vaccine requirement would be the ideal way to go. The CDC recommends at least 95% of passengers and crew be vaccinated. And in fact both Royal’s sister line Celebrity Cruises and  Carnival Cruise Line are appearing to put DeSantis’s decree to the test, with carefully worded policies that boil down to vaccine requirements for anyone on board. In places like Alaska and Galveston, Texas, where they’ve been given the choice, major cruise lines have also only allowed inoculated guests on board—making exceptions only for children. Norwegian Cruise Line says its ships only will sail with vaccinated passengers through October. And all the lines are aiming for 100% crew vaccinations. Richard Fain, chairman of Royal Caribbean Cruises, parent of both Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises, has said repeatedly that he’d prefer that all guests get the jab—adding that surveys show that more than 90% of the line’s customers are vaccinated. Micky Arison, chairman of Carnival Corp. (parent company of brands such as Carnival Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, and Holland America Line), has taken to Twitter to urge vaccines. Cruisers don’t need much persuading. Most are showing a strong desire to sail with other vaxed passengers—a survey of 5,000 readers of the popular website Cruise Critic found last month that 89% would cruise if vaccines are a requirement. But there has also been some pushback. When Mike Bayley, president and chief executive officer of Royal Caribbean, explained policies for unvaccinated guests on Facebook recently, the hundreds of responses he received included both applause and vitriol from opponents espousing anti-vax rhetoric. “My only request is please share your opinion or comments in a polite way,” Bayley said in a follow-up. “If you could read some messages I have received! It’s scary!”"

The delta variant, first identified in India, is spreading rapidly, straining hospitals in Springfield and raising fresh fears that the situation could soon grow worse as holiday gatherings seed fresh cases. Missouri leads the nation with the most new cases per capita in the past 14 days. BERLIN — Germany is easing strict restrictions on travel from Britain, Portugal and some other countries that were imposed because of the rise of the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. Germany’s national disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, said late Monday that Britain, Portugal, Russia, India and Nepal will be removed from the country’s highest risk category of “virus variant areas” effective Wednesday. They will move into the second-highest category of “high-incidence areas.” The U.K. had been in the top risk category since May 23, and was joined last Tuesday by Russia and Portugal, one of Germany’s partners in the European Union. Airlines and others are restricted largely to transporting German citizens and residents from “virus variant areas,” and those who arrive must spend 14 days in quarantine at home. People arriving from “high incidence areas” can avoid quarantine if they can prove that they are fully vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19. Others can cut short a mandatory 10-day quarantine by testing negative after five days. Transport is no longer restricted. Officials have said the listings would be reviewed as the proportion of infections caused by the delta variant in Germany rises. Although overall case numbers are very low, more than half of new cases are now believed to be caused by delta. LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson says people in England will no longer be required by law to wear face masks in indoor public spaces and to keep at least 1 meter (3 feet) apart as soon as later this month. Johnson confirmed Monday that legal sanctions will be replaced by individual “informed decisions” when the country moves to the final stage of its lockdown-lifting roadmap. He said that is scheduled to happen on July 19, though a final decision will come July 12. The change will mean people can throw away masks after months of enforced face-covering, though businesses and transit operators may still require them. They will still be recommended in some enclosed spaces. Britain has recorded more than 128,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest toll in Western Europe. Confirmed infections are rising due to the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus. BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel says that Germany will donate 3 million doses of coronavirus vaccine to countries in the western Balkans region “as soon as possible.” Germany said in late May that it was prepared to donate a total of 30 million doses to poorer countries before the end of this year. Merkel said Monday that most of those doses will be given to the U.N.-backed COVAX program to get vaccines to needy nations, but 3 million will be given directly to the western Balkan countries. She spoke after a video meeting with leaders from the region. She didn’t give a specific timeline for the donations. BERLIN — Germany’s disease control center says the country should aim to vaccinate 85% of people ages 12-59 and 90% of people over 60 to prevent the delta variant causing a strong resurgence of coronavirus cases this autumn and winter. Monday’s report by the Robert Koch Institute was based on mathematical modelling and survey findings. It comes as Germany’s infection rate is at its lowest in months. On Monday, the institute said that five new cases per 100,000 residents have been reported over the past week. But the more contagious delta variant is thought to account for more than half of new cases. The report said the vaccination targets are reached soon enough, then “a strong fourth wave in the coming fall/winter appears unlikely,” provided people also use basic hygiene measures and reduce contacts if infection rates rise. Germany had given 56.5% of its entire population at least one vaccine shot by Sunday and 38.9% were fully vaccinated. MADRID — Some regions in Spain are reinstating nightlife restrictions only weeks after dropping them, part of an attempt to stem a spiraling number of coronavirus infections among unvaccinated young people. Fearing that the surging virus could strain healthcare services, health officials in several parts of the country are also hurrying to reach people under 30 with COVID-19 vaccines. Spain’s strict vaccination rollout has so far focused on older, more vulnerable groups. On Friday, the 14-day contagion rate among those ages 20 to 29 years was nearly three times the national average. The virus has also spread among teenagers as a result of trips and parties to celebrate the end of the school year. Thousands have been in isolation nationwide after more than 1,000 infections were tied to student trips to the Mallorca islands and at least 700 have tested positive in mass screenings made in the Navarra region among students who went to a beach resort last month. Nightlife will be completely closed in at least 16 towns of the northern Cantabria region, which leads the nation’s virus tally. MOSCOW — Early trials of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine among children ages 12 to 17 have started in Moscow, city officials said Monday. Deputy Mayor Anastasia Rakova said 100 volunteers have been recruited who haven’t been previously infected with the coronavirus and don’t have health issues that would prevent them from getting the shots. Rakova said the youths will receive a small dose of Sputnik V than what is usually administered for adults. The new trial comes as Russia faces a sharp surge in coronavirus infections and struggles to ramp up its low vaccine uptake. As of last week, only 23 million people, or just over 15% of the country’s 146-million population, have received at least one shot of a coronavirus vaccine. In the meantime, the number of daily new virus cases have more than doubled over the past month, going from roughly 9,000 a day in early June to over 24,000 this week. On Monday, Russia’s state coronavirus task force reported 24,353 new cases and 654 deaths. Russian authorities have registered over 5.6 million confirmed cases of the virus in the pandemic and 138,579 deaths. BERLIN — The German government is rejecting calls to fine people who don’t show up to vaccination appointments and fail to cancel them beforehand. The head of the German Red Cross’s Berlin branch, Mario Czaja, has suggested fines of 25 to 30 euros ($29.65 to $35.60) for people who fail to turn up for appointments at vaccination centers. He says the number of such no-shows has increased in recent weeks. His call has drawn a mixed response. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said Monday that appointments are “valuable” and appealed to people to cancel if they can’t keep them. But he said that “the federal government has no plans for fines.” Health Ministry spokeswoman Parissa Hajebi said that “we want to motivate citizens to get vaccinated and we don’t to scare them off and threaten punishment.” She said the ministry didn’t have information that no-shows were a widespread phenomenon. Germany had given 56.5% of its population at least one vaccine shot by Sunday and 38.9% were fully vaccinated. ISLAMABAD — Normalcy returned at COVID-19 vaccination centers across Pakistan on Monday, days after Washington delivered 2.5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine to Islamabad. That enabled Pakistan's government to overcome shortages of specific vaccines which were needed to inoculate expatriate workers wishing to travel abroad. Moderna vaccines were delivered to Pakistan last week by Washington in partnership with the COVAX global vaccine initiative and UNICEF. Before receiving this vaccine, Pakistan had mostly relied on Chinese vaccines. Pakistan faced the shortage of specific vaccines last month after some Middle Eastern countries asked travelers to produce a certificate to show they’ve received specific vaccines, including the Moderna, Pfizer or AstraZeneca shots. LONDON — Britain’s royal palace says the Duchess of Cambridge is self-isolating after a contact tested positive for the coronavirus. Kate had been due to attend events with her husband Prince William on Monday celebrating the 73rd birthday of Britain’s National Health Service. But the couple’s Kensington Palace office says the duchess is self-isolating at home after coming into contact last week with someone who subsequently tested positive. Under current British rules, contacts of confirmed coronavirus cases must quarantine at home for 10 days. The palace says Kate, who is 39, does not have any symptoms of COVID-19. Both Kate and William received first doses of coronavirus vaccine in May. BRUSSELS — Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel has been hospitalized and is under observation “as a precautionary measure” after testing positive for COVID-19 a week earlier. A government official, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity, said there was no update with new information early Monday after Bettel had been taken in for 24 hours of testing and medical analysis on Sunday. The 48-year-old Bettel announced his positive test just after he had attended an European Union summit with 26 other leaders from the bloc for two days. At first he experienced only mild symptoms. But on Sunday, he had to be hospitalized. EU summit organizers said they were confident that all virus precaution measures had been strictly adhered to during the two-day meeting. So far, no other leader has said he or she tested positive. COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka on Monday received a first batch of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, becoming the first country in South Asia to get the U.S.-made COVID-19 jab. Officials say 26,000 doses of Pfizer vaccine directly purchased by the Sri Lankan government was flown into the country on Monday. Health authorities say that Sri Lanka had signed agreements to purchase 5 million Pfizer doses this year. The country is expected to receive about 200,000 Pfizer doses this month. Sri Lankan President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa tweeted that “Sri Lanka becomes the first country in South Asia to acquire a contingent of Pfizer vaccines.” Sri Lankan health authorities have so far used AstraZeneca doses manufactured in India, China's Sinopharm and Russia's Sputnik V in the country's battle against COVID-19. SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea has reported 711 new cases of the coronavirus as infections continued to grow in the greater capital area. It was the third straight day of over 700 cases and the highest daily jump for a Monday since early January, when the country was enduring its worst wave of the pandemic. Usually a smaller number of cases are reported at the start of the week, due to reduced testing on weekends, and the country’s caseload may grow faster over the next few days. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said around 550 of the new cases came from the populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials delayed a planned easing of social distancing measures to cope with a rise in transmissions. Cases were also reported in most of the major cities and towns across the country, including Busan, Daejeon and the North and South Gyeongsang provinces. WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden says the American people are closer than ever to declaring independence from a deadly virus. The president made the comments Sunday at a July Fourth celebration at the White House. He told a crowd of service members and first responders to think back to where this nation was a year ago and think about how far the nation has come. During the brief and optimistic comments, Biden said that thanks to the power of science, the country is seeing a return to normal and the return of economic health. But he warned that the nation has not defeated the virus. He encouraged those who have not been vaccinated to get their shots. He said the vaccines are important for the nation to avoid where it was a year ago. JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia is requiring foreign visitors to be fully vaccinated as one of the entry requirements as the country tries to curb the spread of COVID-19. Ganip Warsito, National Task Force for COVID-19 Mitigation Chief, says that starting on Tuesday, both foreigners and Indonesian nationals entering the country have to show digital or physical proof that they have been fully vaccinated. The obligation to show vaccination cards can be excluded in some cases, including diplomatic visas and service visas, and during official visits at ministerial level. The government is also extending the quarantine time for foreign travelers from five days to eight days. As of Monday, CoxHealth and the city’s other hospital, Mercy Springfield, were treating 213 COVID-19 patients, up from 168 on Friday. As recently as May 24, the two hospitals had just 31 patients. “After what we’ve seen in the last month everyone is just holding their breath, especially after a holiday weekend like this, knowing that there were large gatherings,” said Erik Frederick, the chief administrative officer of Mercy Springfield. Many communities that held off on Fourth of July festivities in 2020 held them this year.

Italy, the former European epicenter of the pandemic, reported the most new infections in over three months. Greece had a record-high number of new cases, and France said daily infections reached a four-month peak. The CDC reversed its guidance to say that people in close contact with a COVID-positive person don't need to get tested.This is not science. It’s politics. Politics that are dangerous to public health.It's indefensible. He accused Republican President Donald Trump of using the agency to “forward his political agenda,” saying it’s “frightening and it is alarming.” “The only plausible rationale is they want fewer people taking tests because, as the president has said, if we don’t take tests you won’t know that people are Covid-positive and the number of Covid-positive people will come down,” Cuomo said. “But it totally violates public health standards, and rationale and just fosters his failed policy of denial.” The state will continue with its travel advisory requiring mandatory quarantine, and Cuomo cautioned New Yorkers and private companies against following the CDC guidance. Cuomo urged New Yorkers to instead follow state recommendations, and to seek advice from public health experts and epidemiologists. The number of positive coronavirus cases in the state remained low, with 0.79% of the 71,000 tests conducted on Aug. 25 coming up positive. There were 492 hospitalizations and three virus-related deaths, according to state data. North Carolina State University’s season opening game against Virginia Tech has been pushed back to Sept. 26, according to a Yahoo report, marking another setback for efforts to push ahead with the college-football season. The NC State Wolfpack were scheduled to start their season on Sept. 12 in Blacksburg, Virginia, but a cluster of Covid-19 cases forced the athletic department to temporarily pause all activities Monday. Arizona on Wednesday reported 187 new virus cases, a 0.1% increase to 199,459 that was below the prior seven-day average of 0.3%. The positivity rate fell to 4% after a one-day spike of 17.3% the day before. The state Department of Health Services recorded 104 deaths, the most in a week, bringing the toll to 4,896. Italy recorded 1,367 new cases Wednesday, the highest number in three months and a half, on the day the government ruled out a new lockdown. Many of the new infections involve Italians returning from vacations either within the country or abroad. The Lombardy region said two out of three of the latest cases are holidaymakers returning from outside of Italy. In response to the surge, Italy is ramping up testing in ports and airports, with a record 93,529 tests carried out Wednesday. Florida reported 608,722 cases on Wednesday, up 0.5% from a day earlier, compared with an average increase of 0.6% in the previous seven days. The 7-day rolling case total was 24,675, the lowest since June 23, according to the health department report, which includes data through Tuesday. Deaths reached 10,733, an increase of 153, or 1.4%, and the seven-day rolling total was 801, the lowest in more than a month. Deaths often trail infections by weeks, and generally take even longer to be reflected in the data. Moscow is inviting all its residents to participate in Phase 3 testing of a Covid-19 vaccine that was approved for use earlier this month, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on his blog Wednesday. Russia approved the use of the Sputnik V vaccine, which Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute is developing with the sovereign Russian Direct Investment Fund and the Defense Ministry, before it finished clinical trials. The testing will continue even as medical workers are vaccinated. Many members of the local elite, including one of President Vladimir Putin’s daughters, have already been inoculated. The capital accounts for more than a quarter of Russia’s nearly 1 million cases. Moderna Inc. presented new safety data from an early trial that provides the first evidence that its Covid-19 vaccine stimulates the immune systems of older people. In a phase 1 trial, Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine produced “consistently high levels” of neutralizing antibodies -- a key component of the body’s protective response -- in older adults, the company said in a statement. Antibody levels produced in people more than 55 years old were comparable to those seen in younger adults, the company said in a statement. The findings are important because older adults often don’t respond as well to vaccines as younger adults. New Jersey’s 1,200 gyms can reopen on Sept. 1 at 25% capacity with spaced workout equipment, masking and other safety precautions, according to a senior official in Governor Phil Murphy’s administration. The fitness centers’ return, in a state with almost 16,000 novel coronavirus deaths, will mark a major step toward full reopening after Murphy, a first-term Democrat, closed non-essential businesses on March 21. Indoor dining and theaters remain off-limits with no targeted opening date, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of Murphy’s 1 p.m. announcement. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the Trump administration is examining executive actions to help airline employees facing furloughs if Congress doesn’t provide assistance in a new round of stimulus. American Airlines Group Inc. has said it will furlough and layoff about 19,000 employees on Oct. 1 if Congress doesn’t provide additional financial relief. The airline industry has been badly hurt by the coronavirus outbreak, which caused many Americans to cancel travel plans. The WEF will move its annual meeting, normally held each January in the Swiss ski town of Davos, to early summer, according to a statement on Wednesday. While convening to discuss economic challenges was urgent, “the advice from experts is that we cannot do so safely in January,” the organization said. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will testify before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis on Sept. 1, the panel said in a statement. The hearing will focus on questions of additional economic relief for children, workers and families and the implementation of existing stimulus programs, the panel said. Mexico remains on track for its worst recession in nearly a century after the coronavirus pandemic led to the biggest quarterly contraction in data going back to 1993. Gross domestic product fell 17.1% in the second quarter compared to the three previous months, the national statistics institute reported on its website. The contraction was slightly less than the median estimate for a 17.2% drop from economists surveyed by Bloomberg and the 17.3% fall estimated in preliminary data last month. China’s BGI Genomics defended its Covid-19 tests after Swedish authorities said positive test results for about 3,700 people will be nullified. A spokesperson said BGI’s tests -- supplied to more than 180 countries and regions -- are among the world’s most sensitive, and that a high rate of positive cases shouldn’t be seen as indicative of false results. Instead, BGI says, the tests pick up infected people who appear healthy. “BGI prioritizes product quality” and “is willing to engage with clients and organizations at home and abroad in close communication,” the company said in emailed comments. Italy has ruled out imposing a new nationwide lockdown despite an increase in coronavirus cases, as the country struggles to emerge from the worst recession in living memory. Roberto Speranza in Rome, Aug. 26. The rise in contagion has been limited, with very low impact on health services, Health Minister Roberto Speranza said in an interview with Bloomberg News. “We have few cases and the situation is under control, with pressure on hospitals that is very low, minimal,” he said. The average age of people who’ve tested positive in the last week is 30, and most have mild symptoms or none at all, he said. There’s no relief in site for the global tourism industry: In Thailand, industry executives expect consolidation as hotel operators and airlines face a liquidity crunch. Hotel operators are likely to merge and local and overseas funds could step in to acquire assets, Dusit Thani Pcl Chief Executive Officer Suphajee Suthumpun said at a virtual conference. Separately, tourist arrivals in Mauritius were 53% lower than a year earlier, official figures showed. Visitors for the six months through June fell to 304,881 from 650,082, with revenue from the sector down 48% to 16.1 billion rupees ($410 million). Hungarian diplomats asking to carry out their work from home during the coronavirus pandemic will be fired, according to Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto. “That’s not a game we play at the Foreign Ministry,” Szijjarto said in comments broadcast on his Facebook page. “If someone wants to play that game, that can be done outside the ministry.” The 41-year old Szijjarto, who’s been Hungary’s top diplomat for six years and is one of Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s closest subordinates, is facing calls to quit himself after being photographed earlier this month vacationing on a luxury yacht. The death toll in Iran crossed 21,000 even though daily fatalities dropped for a third day. The number of infections reached 365,606, with new cases declining slightly to 2,243 in the past 24 hours, according to the latest Health Ministry data. Iran had an average of 127 deaths and 2,189 new cases per day over the past week. Moderna presented new safety data from an early trial that provides the first evidence that its vaccine stimulates the immune systems of older people.

California is working with PerkinElmer Inc. to build a laboratory testing site with a full supply chain that will enable the state to add as many as 150,000 tests per day, more than doubling its current capacity, Governor Gavin Newsom said at a press briefing. The agreement comes with a guarantee that tests will have a 24- to 48-hour turnaround time, helping California vastly improve its processing from the current average turnaround of five to seven days, he said. The state has identified a site and “will be moving forward very very quickly,” Newsom said. The governor also said he doesn’t agree with new CDC guidelines shifting testing away from asymptomatic people. “That is not the policy guideline that we will embrace or adopt in the state of California,” he said. The Trump administration said orders by four states led by Democratic governors requiring nursing homes to admit coronavirus patients may have caused the disease to spread, resulting in the deaths of thousands of elderly residents. The Justice Department said that New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan mandated that people be accepted by the elder-care facilities “often without adequate testing.” In a statement on Wednesday, the department said it’s seeking data which will be used to determine if investigations should commence. Coronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 0.8% as compared with the same time Tuesday to 5.8 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. The increase matched the average daily gain over the past week. Deaths rose by 0.8% to 179,150. Illinois reported 37 more Covid-19 deaths on Wednesday, up from 29 a day earlier and the highest count since July 7, according to an emailed statement. The state reported 2,157 coronavirus cases, up from 1,680 on Wednesday. Illinois’s seven-day positivity rate was at 4%, down from 4.1% reported on Tuesday California’s Senate halted its session Wednesday after a person in the chamber tested positive for Covid-19. All senators and staff were asked to “hold in place,” remain in their offices or continue working remotely as the situation was addressed, according to a note sent to workers. The move comes at a key time for the legislature, with all bills required to pass by Aug. 31. The state reported more progress in its fight against the outbreak Wednesday, with 6,004 new cases, a 0.9% increase and less than the 14-day average of 6,646. The average rate of positive tests over 14 days fell to 6.1% from 6.3%. Hospitalizations dropped 1.3% to 4,365 patients, a two-month low. France reported 5,429 new Covid-19 cases over the past 24 hours, a four-month high that comes after similarly important surges in recent days. Prime Minister Jean Castex will hold a press conference on Thursday to address the health situation as infections rise. Greece reported a record-high 293 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number to 9280. The number is the highest daily increase since the beginning of the pandemic. The average age of people who tested positive is 39. The country also recorded five new deaths, bringing the total to 248. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday said the state won’t follow recent guidance on the coronavirus from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, calling it “political propaganda.” The CDC this week said that people who have potentially been exposed to the virus and are asymptomatic don’t need to be tested. The agency, contrary to its previous recommendations, also said that people traveling from hot spots no longer need to self-quarantine for 14 days. “We’re not going to follow the CDC guidance,” Cuomo, a Democrat, said on a conference call with the media.

Florida reported 608,722 cases, up 0.5% from a day earlier, compared with an average increase of 0.6% in the previous seven days. Deaths reached 10,733, an increase of 153, or 1.4%. Arizona reported 187 new virus cases, a 0.1% increase to 199,459 that was below the prior seven-day average of 0.3%. The state recorded 104 deaths, the most in a week, bringing the toll to 4,896."

Cases Jump; Merkel Declares Covid ‘Watershed’: Virus Update,[],prognosis,"The U.S. added the fewest deaths since Monday, even as infections have been rising nationally. New York state reported the most daily cases in more than a month. German Chancellor Angela Merkel threatened to assert federal control over measures to stem the Covid-19 pandemic, picking a legal fight that reflects the gravity of the latest surge in infections. In an extraordinary turn of events, Merkel said she may use federal law to regain the initiative after rescinding a wide-ranging lockdown for the Easter holidays amid a storm of criticism. She expressed exasperation with what she described as broken commitments by the leaders of Germany’s 16 states. “We can’t go on like this,” Merkel said in an interview with ARD television. “I’m declaring a watershed -- and I’m not done thinking about it, either.”  The federal government isn’t the best messenger to combat vaccine hesitancy among some Republicans and should cede the way to a more “community-centric” approach, said former U.S. Food and Drug Administration chief Scott Gottlieb. “We should be looking at every single interaction that patients have with the medical system, and trying to offer a vaccination at those points of care, through a provider that patients know,” Gottlieb said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” Gottlieb said current outbreaks in Michigan, around Boston and in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were “worrisome” as cases nationwide tick up. The Biden administration could try allocating more vaccines to regional hot-spots, he said. “If we could just get two or three more weeks of around three million vaccines a day, that’s going to be a pretty big backstop against a true fourth surge,” he said. California reported 2,998 new Covid-19 cases yesterday, down from the previous day’s 3,278, according to the health department’s website. Deaths rose by 195, lower than the 215 reported on Friday. The state’s 14-day positive test rate hovered at a record low 1.7%. California has administered more than 17 million vaccines. China is partnering with the United Arab Emirates to make millions of doses of its state-backed Sinopharm vaccine, in a deal that takes manufacturing of the shot overseas for the first time and deepens Beijing’s influence in the Middle East. A newly-created joint venture between Sinopharm CNBG and Abu Dhabi-based G42 aims to produce up to 200 million doses annually at a new plant that will become operational this year, the companies said in a statement. Production on a smaller scale has already started at an existing Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries PSCplant with a capacity of 2 million doses per month. President Joe Biden said most U.S. states are meeting his goal of opening up vaccinations to all adults by May 1, while pointing out four that haven’t: New York, South Carolina, Arkansas and Wyoming. Iraq received 336,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine on Sunday, according to the government’s official Twitter account citing the health ministry’s spokesperson. The country agreed with the vaccine manufacturer last year to get 16 million doses, the spokesperson said. More shipments of the AstraZeneca vaccine are set to gradually arrive in the coming days and weeks, covering 20% of the population. The new chief executive of hotel group Marriott International Inc. called for the U.S. and other countries to do more to create something akin to a vaccine passport to unlock international travel.In an interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation” Anthony Capuano, who took over as CEO of Maryland-based Marriott in February, said he was concerned that no one was coordinating current efforts to develop a system to allow international travel for people who have been vaccinated. “We need a comprehensive and global solution for it to be effective,” Capuano told CBS. The Washington Post on Sunday reported that the White House was consulting with the private sector about developing a possible app-based vaccine passport system. The efforts were focused on greater coordination and identifying privacy and other issues raised by the need for such a passport, according to the report. It said the White House had identified at least 17 different initiatives now underway to develop portable vaccine credentials. New York state reported 9,395 new cases, the largest daily increase since early February. Average daily cases rose about 3% over the last seven days compared with the previous week. Hospitalizations decreased slightly, to 4,529, according to a statement from Governor Andrew Cuomo. While that number has been relatively stable in recent weeks, the state still has the most Covid-19 hospitalizations in the nation, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. New York has the second highest number of cases per capita after New Jersey, CDC data show. Another 64 people died. President Joe Biden’s top medical adviser on Sunday stopped short of telling parents it would be safe this summer to loose their children on community playgrounds and ship them off to summer camp.In an interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation” Dr. Anthony Fauci said he was concerned that while Covid-19 cases and fatalities had come down from a winter peak they had settled at a high plateau because of new variants and states loosening restrictions. Increasing travel, such as that seen over the spring break school holiday in the U.S., was also a concern as travel inevitably led to rising infections, Fauci said. But Fauci said if the acceleration in vaccinations to its latest 3-3.5 million doses a day rate continued, it was “conceivable” families could dispatch their children to camp come summer. The U.S. has “real concerns about the methodology and the process” of a draft World Health Organization report on the origins of the Covid-19 virus, including that the Chinese government “apparently helped to write it,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. The politically contentious report, based on findings by international scientists convened by WHO and China, is expected shortly. While there needs to be “accountability for the past,” the focus should be on building “a stronger system for the future,” Blinken said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Italy reported 19,611 new cases and 297 deaths on Sunday, reflecting a 7.2% positive test rate. New cases in the country remain stable as some regions, including the one around Rome, are set to slightly ease restrictions starting Tuesday. Deputy health minister Pierpaolo Sileri said the slower rate of increase in new infections shows that tight restrictions introduced by Mario Draghi’s government are showing the first results. All truckers arriving into England from outside the U.K. will have to take a Covid-19 test within 48 hours, Transport Minister Grant Shapps said on Twitter. The drivers will then have to take additional tests for each 72 hours they remain, he said. The mandatory testing will help “ensure we keep track of any future coronavirus variants of concern,” he said. As inoculation progresses, EU member states will create a “health pass” from the middle of June to facilitate a rebound in leisure, tourism and business travel, Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal markets commissioner, said Sunday.People will be able to display their vaccination status and most recent Covid-test results with a certificate using a QR code, Breton said. It will be available on a voluntary basis and will respect European data-protection rules, he said. The government of Maharashtra, which encompasses Mumbai, asked authorities to prepare for another lockdown if a resurgence in infections isn’t reined in and residents flout rules. Hospital facilities are quickly reaching capacity, with a fifth of isolation beds already filled up, it said in a statement Sunday. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray asked officials to prepare for food and supplies of other essentials. “There should not be any kind of confusion among the people once a lockdown is announced,” he said. Slovenia will impose an 11-day lockdown amid a surge in new infections driven by the U.K. variant, Prime Minister Janez Jansa said at a press conference at Brdo. The government will also enforce stricter border controls. Between April 1-11 the Alpine state will close schools and most non-essential services, the majority of the public sector will switch to working from home and the government will ask industry to do the same. The government is also reintroducing mandatory masks in public places and a regional travel ban, with the exception of Easter Sunday. Germany may come under pressure to impose a harder lockdown as the infection rate in the nation returns to January levels. The topic will be front and center when Chancellor Angela Merkel is interviewed on the Anne Will show on German state television Sunday night. Bild newspaper reported an emergency meeting between Merkel and state leaders could decide on the course of action in the coming days. German cases topped 28,000 on Saturday, more than three times the rate at the start of the month, underscoring the challenge facing authorities as they attempt to curb the pandemic’s spread. The U.S. added 758 deaths from Covid-19 on Saturday, the fewest since Monday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg. Reported new infections declined to about 63,000, the lowest in three days and a fraction of peaks of more than 300,000 daily cases late December and early January. Vaccinations are picking up in the U.S., with 75% of the population on pace to be covered within an estimated four months, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. Some 3.5 million doses were administered on Saturday, more than the average of 2.7 million over the previous seven days. The EU will block AstraZeneca exports if the company fails to deliver the doses bought by the region on time, according to Thierry Breton, the EU commissioner in charge of fixing the bloc’s vaccination drive. AstraZeneca has met about 30% of its commitment to deliver 70 million doses to the EU in the second quarter, Breton said on RTL radio Sunday.“As long as AstraZeneca doesn’t make good on its obligations, everything that’s produced on European soil is distributed to Europeans,” he said. Britain is planning to offer 3.7 million Covid jabs to the Republic of Ireland, in part to help lift the lockdown in Northern Ireland, saying it would be the first time the U.K. has exported vaccines to the EU, the Sunday Times reported. Britain expects to receive the first doses of the U.S.-made Moderna Inc. vaccine within weeks, a government minister said Sunday. The U.S. has “real concerns about the methodology and the process” of a draft World Health Organization report on the origins of the Covid-19 virus, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel threatened to assert federal control over measures to stem the Covid-19 pandemic, picking a legal fight that reflects the gravity of the latest surge in infections.

The head of Royal Dutch Shell Plc said governments will need to help companies cut customer emissions. Earlier, one of Deutsche Bank AG’s top shareholders signaled his backing for consolidation in Europe’s financial services industry, arguing that the continent’s lenders need scale to compete globally. Billionaire investor Michael Novogratz said he prefers Bitcoin to buying gold. The three-day event kicked off on Monday, with billionaire investor Ray Dalio and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers telling the Forum the U.S. is headed for a period of overheating and inflation that could threaten the recovery. The Qatar Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Investment Promotion Agency Qatar and Media City Qatar are underwriters of the Qatar Economic Forum, Powered by Bloomberg. Indian billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla, who oversees the $46 billion Aditya Birla Group spread across 36 countries, is no longer keen to acquire any firm with a globally diversified supply chain as protectionism and the pandemic increasingly curb the movement of products and people. “We wouldn’t look at a company or a business where you source in one corner of the world and sell in another corner of the world,” Birla told Haslinda Amin in an interview during the Forum. “That’s a reset that has happened on account of growing protectionism.” Volkswagen AG’s chief executive officer predicts that the rise of autonomous-driving technology will ultimately be even more important than the transition to battery power. “This change will transform the industry more than EVs or electrification does,” Herbert Diess said in an interview at the Forum. “The car becomes so different when it’s driving autonomously.” VW is working toward offering autonomous driving in key markets worldwide and spending about 2.5 billion euros ($3 billion) a year on boosting its software capabilities. The company announced last month that it plans to offer a highly automated version of its hippie-era microbus. It is reviving the vehicle as an electric van and will start test drives in Hamburg this year. Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive officer of Glencore Plc, told the Forum that Chinese efforts to cool commodity markets, including releasing metals from its strategic stockpile, will be short lived. Glasenberg said China’s efforts are a “short-term phase” and that the country will have to move to restock strategic supplies that it feeds into the market in order to cool prices. Glasenberg said he expects commodity prices to stay strong for a good while longer, with both China and the U.S. stimulating their economies. For the first time in over a decade China has pledged to release metals stockpiles if it needs to. While planned sales to end users in China could help boost domestic supply, analysts have questioned the country’s ability to influence any uptick in copper demand seen elsewhere. Ben van Beurden, chief executive officer of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, said the company can probably fulfill stringent new targets for its carbon emissions: at a push, he can see a “pathway” to cutting them 45% by 2030, as mandated recently by The Hague. But he cautioned that it would a “different story” if the oil major is obligated to tackle emissions by its customers -- known as Scope-3. Shell can go some of the way by innovating new products and tweaking its business model, van Beurden said, but the “lion’s part” will come down to government policies. These could include measures that encourage the adoption of electric vehicles. “This is not a challenge for one company,” van Beurden said at Forum on Tuesday. “It is a systems challenge that we all have to embrace.” Qatar has received interest from prospective investors in its project to expand liquefied natural gas production amounting to double what it was seeking, said Energy Minister Saad Al-Kaabi. Royal Dutch Shell PLC, TotalEnergies SE and Exxon Mobil Corp. were among the companies that submitted bids to partner on the project, he said. The project will lift Qatar’s annual LNG output to 110 million tons from 77 million tons, and LNG buyers have offered to receive “double what we require,” he said. The leaders of some of the world’s biggest oil companies said crude prices are likely to keep rising as a lack of investments affects future supply, joining major commodity traders and banks in predicting the current rally has more room to run. There’s “quite a chance” crude will reach $100 a barrel, TotalEnergies SE Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said at the Forum. The energy transition means there has not been enough investment in oil and gas projects and that could push prices higher, Qatar’s Energy Minister Saad Al-Kaabi said. China’s military deployment along its disputed Himalayan border with India, and uncertainty over whether Beijing will fulfill a promise on troop reductions, remains a challenge for relations between the two neighbors, India’s foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said. “The issue there is whether China would live up to the commitments it has made -- written commitments it has made -- about both countries not allowing a large armed force at the border,” Jaishankar said in an interview at the Forum. China’s “close-up deployment still continues, especially in Ladakh,” he said. The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated a deterioration in democracy in Africa and the continent may require a fresh crop of statesmen to boost participation, philanthropist Mohamed Ibrahim said. The Ibrahim Index of African Governance, a gauge that’s popular with investors seeking opportunities in the continent, has shown some improvement over the past 10 to 15 years, he said in an interview at the Qatar Economic Forum on Tuesday. But measures of democracy and participation have either stagnated or declined, he said. “On the balance, things deteriorated actually,” Ibrahim said. “The pandemic did not help. It emphasized the autocratic stance of some of our leaders.” “They like to face people, they like to feel people, they like to notice the body language,” said Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker. People “don’t like to just sit in front of a screen and conduct business,” he said. The comments, echoed by the heads of Boeing Co., British Airways owner IAG SA and African carrier Rwandair, signal growing confidence that at least a significant portion of aviation’s most lucrative segment will bounce back once restrictions are lifted. While business travel will take longer to recover than holidays or family trips, about half of IAG’s corporate customers plan to fly by the end of the year, CEO Luis Gallego said. “The shape of business travel may change but as Akbar said, face to face meetings are going to be crucial.” Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabor Al Thani, Qatar’s former prime minister and now one of Deutsche Bank’s largest shareholders, said it’s time for European banks to consolidate if they want to keep up with American and Chinese peers. “Everybody’s waiting to have a better valuation to think about merging, but I believe to merge now is better because the market is being taken by the big banks,” he said. Asked if this logic also applied to Deutsche Bank, he said “mergers are inevitable,” but did not specifically comment on what the German lender should do. A notable property investor, particularly in London real estate, Sheikh Hamad said he sees better prospects for a recovery in hotels than in office or retail space, with vaccinated people quickest to resume their pre-pandemic behavior. But he’s playing it safe in the markets, and staying away from SPACs, which he says are “already overdone.” Sheikh Hamad exhorted regional leaders to make good on promises to introduce democratic reforms. Middle Eastern leaders have to “give democracy to the people in a very realistic path and very realistic timetable, but a timetable to be respected by the governments,” he said. “Not, you know, one step ahead and two steps back. Because that’s what leads people to go for revolutions.” Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani scheduled the country’s first legislative elections for October, 16 years after they were mandated by the country’s constitution. Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest cocoa producer, plans to raise ethical standards for its exports as the country faces increasing consumer pressure to grow the ingredient more sustainably. The West African nation is working to tackle the use of child labor and deforestation, while also improving farmer pay to continue exporting to the European Union, which buys almost 70% of its output, according to Prime Minister Patrick Achi. The 27-nation bloc could adopt new sustainability rules by the end of the year. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the conference the U.K. sees “no contradiction” between global economic growth and “protecting our planet.” “There is no reason why humanity should not prosper and safeguard our planet at the same time,” Johnson told delegates in a video address. “We have the ingenuity, and the technology to achieve but all the remains to do is to summon the will.” The U.K. has grown its economy by 78% over the last 30 years and managed to cut carbon emissions by 44%, Johnson said. Almost a decade ago about 40% of U.K. electricity came from coal, the figure in 2021 is just 2%, he said, with a target to eliminate its use altogether by 2024. As chair of the G-7 group of industrialized nations this year, the U.K. made climate protection one of its key targets. Johnson is due to host the COP26 climate summit in Scotland later in 2021. On a separate panel, Britain’s Investment Minister Gerry Grimston said the country’s 2050 net-zero goal opens up “enormous” investment opportunities. “Our pipeline has never been more active than it is now.” The head of the World Trade Organization said she’s hopeful that WTO members will soon reach “pragmatic solutions” aimed at increasing access to vaccines in the developing world. “My hope and expectation is that this will happen quickly because lives are at stake,” Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said. She hopes that in July WTO members will reach “some pragmatic solutions that will allow developing countries automaticity of access to vaccines whilst at the same time making sure we don’t disincentivize research and innovation.” Read More: WTO Wades Into Vaccine Feud as Merkel, Pharma Balk at Biden Plan Billionaire investor Novogratz said he looks at Bitcoin as “digital gold.” “If you’re going to be long gold, Bitcoin is a better version because it’s got the same macro tailwinds but it is also very early in the adoption curve.” WATCH: Michael Novogratz, founder, CEO, and chairman at Galaxy Digital, says he’s still a big buyer of bitcoin and views the cryptocurrency as digital gold. Source: Bloomberg “Crypto is a luxury in the developed markets, it’s a necessity in the developing markets, where you’ve got currencies that devalue 20% to 30% every year,” Novogratz said. For the general user of crypto, though, Bitcoin and Ethereum is “probably enough,” he said. Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital, said on the same panel that there are a lot of good crypto products besides Bitcoin to invest in. “This year, Bitcoin is up 34%, our hedge fund that trades the liquid tokens is up 240%,” he said. “Ethereum is the second-biggest, it’s very important.” “It’s very hard to tell” why the currencies have been dropping, Binance Holdings CEO Changpeng Zhao said in an interview, citing positive news like El Salvador adopting Bitcoin and negative headlines such as China cracking down on the currency. “From our perspective, we just see people placing orders.” China’s intensifying cryptocurrency crackdown has left Bitcoin flirting with $30,000, a price level seen as key to the short-term outlook for the largest virtual currency. Technologies that integrate the finance industry’s disparate networks offer an outsized investment opportunity, according to Blythe Masters, CEO of Motive Capital. The opportunity to develop “platform-like businesses that connect broad networks” is particularly exciting for financial services, Masters said during a panel discussing fintech, adding that the sector has lagged “in terms of the disruption that platform businesses can bring to this space.” The potential market is vast. “More than one in every four dollars that are spent on technology are spent on financial technology by both financial firms and non-financial firms,” Masters said. “That adds up to about a $10 trillion market opportunity.” Awareness of the risks of major cyber attacks is widespread, Swiss Re Chairman Sergio Ermotti said, while questioning whether enough potential fixes are in place. Risks in the cyber space are very hard to predict and the premiums for insuring against cyber attacks now represent some $7 billion per annum for insurance companies, Ermotti said, adding that Swiss Re expects demand for insurance to cover such risks to increase three fold to almost $20 billion by 2025. Some estimates show that cyber risk claims to insurance companies currently amount to $1 trillion a year, Ermotti said.

Even as vaccines embolden countries like Israel and the U.K. to plot paths to reopening, authorities around the world are tightening the screws to stop Covid-19 mutations slipping through quarantine models designed to contain a less aggressive virus. With questions hanging over the efficacy of vaccines on mutated strains, this new front in the public-health battle is damping hopes of a swift rebound in international air travel. A visitor receives a Covid-19 vaccine at a mass vaccination center at Epsom Downs Racecourse in the U.K. in January. A Covid-19 testing area at Vancouver International Airport in Canada on Feb. 22. “European countries are still discouraging or restricting foreign travelers. It’s far from clear when they’ll fully open their borders to holidaymakers again.”  While U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday that foreign travel could start as soon as May 17, triggering a surge in flight bookings, England has only just put in place its toughest border curbs of the pandemic, imposing 10-day hotel quarantines for British and Irish nationals and residents arriving from dozens of countries. Meanwhile, in parts of the world that have been most successful in keeping out the virus, quarantine rules are being tightened and policy makers are striking a more cautious tone on when travel may start again. Authorities in Melbourne are sketching out plans for custom-built isolation facilities outside the city. Hong Kong has one of the most extreme policies: a soul-crushing 21-day hotel lockup awaits residents arriving from outside China. The different requirements are neutering a push by airlines for a standardized global response to get people flying again. The International Air Transport Association’s proposal for test or vaccine certificates to replace quarantines hasn’t gained traction with governments. Brace Yourself: Long-Haul Travel Might Not Start Until 2023 “We cannot seriously talk about recovery as long as quarantine requirements are in place,” said Volodymyr Bilotkach, a lecturer in air-transport management at the Singapore Institute of Technology. “Countries continue making up their rules, changing them as they go.” Isolation can take a toll on travelers stuck in hotel rooms, which often have sealed windows and minimal space.

Kim, who has also endured several 14-day quarantines in Seoul, has sought treatment from a psychiatrist and told his manager he’s not sure how long he can maintain this lifestyle. “It was getting mentally difficult,” said the 42-year-old. “When you’re on your own, one tends to think a lot and that’s not a good experience.” Governments have decided it’s a price worth paying to keep out fast-moving Covid-19 strains from places such as South Africa, which was linked to a 16-fold increase in cases in neighboring Zambia within a month. Mutations have also been tied to Brazil and the U.K. “The problem is at this point we have very little information about these variants,” said Abrar Chughtai, an epidemiologist who lectures at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. Tighter quarantines might be sensible as a precautionary measure, he said. Why the Mutated Coronavirus Variants Are So Worrisome: QuickTake The U.K.’s restrictions aim to shield the country as the government accelerates its vaccination program. Adults arriving from a so-called red list of countries must pick up the 1,750-pound ($2,450) bill for hotel quarantine, and face a 10,000-pound fine or a decade in prison for breaking the rules. Prime Minister Johnson fueled optimism this week by saying the end of the pandemic is in sight for England, unless infection rates surge again. All adults in the U.K. are due to be offered a vaccine shot by the end of July, and data suggest one dose provides a high level of protection. There are signs elsewhere, too, that curbs on travelers could ease with inoculations and lower caseloads. Taiwan, which has had only nine virus deaths, may loosen border controls next month, while Macau has reopened to quarantine-free travel from mainland China. Thailand is considering scrapping two-week isolations for vaccinated tourists. More than 63 million doses have been given to Americans. More Than 209 Million Shots Given: Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker At the same time, fresh restrictions are being imposed on travelers to block Covid-19 variants. As of Feb. 22, passengers on flights into Canada must pay for three nights at a government-approved hotel as part of their mandatory 14-day quarantines. The New Zealand government is considering forcing travelers from overseas to isolate at home even after their 14-day mandatory hotel quarantine ends. From Feb. 1, anyone entering Vietnam has to do 21 days of quarantine at their own expense. The U.K.’s vision for overseas travel in May needs destinations that are open, too. Meanwhile, the constantly changing rules and approaches are wreaking havoc with flight networks and schedules. Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. axed services to Vancouver, San Francisco and other cities from this week and has introduced an arduous shift cycle for crew members to bypass Hong Kong’s new rules on quarantine. Cathay crew can volunteer for a 21-day work shift, during which they stay in a company hotel whenever they fly into Hong Kong. That is followed by 14 days of quarantine in another hotel, and then 14 days of leave. “The focus of governments is almost universally on containing the spread of the virus across borders,” IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac wrote in his blog in early February. “There is little hope of an imminent return to normal.” More: Airlines Pick Ex-BA Boss Walsh to Lead Fight to Survive Crisis Rather than gradually being wound back, some quarantines are approaching permanency. The Australian state of Victoria has started looking at “long-term” solutions for separating overseas arrivals from the local population, with arrivals housed in newly-built complexes near airports. The review followed an outbreak of the virulent U.K. strain from a quarantine hotel in Melbourne. In Hong Kong, Kim has become a disheartened isolation veteran. “No matter how long or short the quarantine is, it’s still a very difficult experience,” he said."

Source: EPA The EPA is ordering a halt to sales of Allied BioScience Inc.’s SurfaceWise2 product amid concerns about the effectiveness of the disinfectant used to combat coronaviruses in some American Airlines Group Inc. planes and airport facilities. The Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday it had ordered Allied BioScience to immediately stop selling and distributing the product amid “scientific concerns regarding product performance.” The agency also revoked emergency exemptions that had allowed the product’s use in Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas. “EPA laboratory testing indicates the product’s performance is less reliable under real-world conditions, particularly when it is exposed to moisture or abrasion,” the agency said in a news release. “Based on all the available efficacy data for SurfaceWise2, EPA does not support its continued emergency use.” Representatives of Allied BioScience did not immediately respond to requests for comment. American Airlines said in a statement Thursday that it had stopped using SurfaceWise2, which was only applied to aircraft routed through Texas. “We will continue to follow all EPA and federal guidance on this matter,” the company said in an emailed statement. The EPA’s emergency authorization of SurfaceWise 2 for some locations in Texas -- including American Airlines facilities and two orthopedic clinics -- was heralded last August as a potential turning point in preventing the spread of Covid-19 and encouraging more Americans to fly amid the pandemic. The EPA said that the disinfectant could kill coronaviruses for as long as seven days after its application on surfaces, such as counters and seats, when used in combination with other treatments. Former President Donald Trump’s EPA administrator at the time, Andrew Wheeler, called the anti-viral spray a “game-changing announcement for our efforts to combat coronavirus and Covid-19.” Federal law generally requires pesticides such as SurfaceWise2 to be registered before they can be distributed, but the EPA can make exemptions for unregistered uses of the chemicals to address emergencies. However, the EPA said it began a fresh analysis of the product after new data become available this year, while also investigating its sales, marketing and distribution."

The latest sign that air travel is picking up again in America is the U.S. West Coast bringing in three cargoes of jet fuel from Asia to satisfy demand from airlines. At Los Angeles International Airport, Sunday marked the second-busiest day since the start of the pandemic. Passenger traffic through airport security showed eight of the 10 busiest days in the past year have occurred this month. United Airlines Holdings Inc. Chief Executive Officer Scott Kirby said Tuesday there is strong evidence of pent-up demand for air travel. More Americans taking to the skies have created a healthier jet fuel market on the U.S. West Coast. Inventories in the region are at the lowest seasonally in nine years and Los Angeles jet’s discount to diesel narrowed this month to the smallest since early February. The combination has attracted about 819,000 barrels of booked jet fuel shipments from Asia, enough to fill a Boeing 737-800 about 5,000 times. Heightened jet flows to the U.S. West Coast are signaling that the pocket of the oil market hit hardest by the pandemic is finally starting to shape up. The lull in travel that decimated the airline industry in 2020 -- and the jet market -- is reversing, another sign of an economic rebound. United’s April bookings suggest more passengers are on jets than in 2019 and Delta Air Lines Inc. said earlier this month it’s seeing more normal travel booking behavior by consumers. At LAX, the West Coast’s primary jet fuel consumer, foot traffic through security hit 55,886 people on Sunday, said Stephanie Sampson, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles World Airports. Booked jet fuel shipments from Asia to the Americas in the week ended April 19 surged to about 1.6 million barrels, a level last seen at the start of the pandemic, according to fixtures seen by Bloomberg. Aramco Trading hired Nave Sextans and Torm Philippines, while Valero Energy Corp. scheduled Energy Ariadne to ship jet fuel to the U.S. West Coast from South Korea. The journey typically takes about three weeks. The U.S. West Coast will especially need the jet fuel. The bump higher in demand coincides with maintenance at key refineries in the region. Chevron Corp.’s El Segundo refinery near LAX is expected to begin work in May and maintenance is currently underway at BP Plc’s Cherry Point plant in Washington, the largest supplier of jet fuel to the Seattle, Portland and Vancouver airports. In Asia, jet fuel consumption remains lackluster as flying within the region is muted amid viral resurgences in several countries, with the exception of China. Jet fuel flows to the U.S. will likely continue, said George Dix, an analyst at Energy Aspects Ltd., given that Asian markets remain well-supplied at a time when coronavirus cases are spiking."

The International Air Transport Association’s app is a digital solution that can be used by people to store Covid test results from accredited laboratories. The app, being trialled by more than 20 carriers including Singapore Airlines Ltd., will be available for download in the second half of this month. IATA hopes such solutions will help drive the adoption of digital health certificates. “As we work to safely rebuild the Changi air hub, we will continue to explore other solutions that can provide similarly secure and verifiable means of sharing health certificates for safe international travel,” Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore Director-General Kevin Shum said in a statement Monday, referring to the country’s Changi airport. With coronavirus cases in the city-state under control, the focus has swung to vaccinations and reopening borders. Because Singapore has no domestic market to speak of, international travel is vital to the economy and Singapore Airlines’ financial prospects. Talks are underway with Hong Kong and Australia to start travel bubbles that would replace mandatory quarantine with tests. Singapore is set to expand vaccines to under 45-year-olds from June and is maintaining its end-2021 schedule to vaccinate everyone. About 1.05 million people, or 18.4% of the population, have received their first dose. The nation is also exploring mutual recognition of vaccination certificates with several countries and regions, Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung said in Parliament on Monday. These initiatives could be physical or digital and will need to be temper-proof and verifiable, he said. “Singapore will continue to holistically evaluate the Covid-19 situation in various countries and regions and explore the possibility restoring air travel when it is safe to do so,” Ong said. “And we have been proactively doing so given the importance of our global connections.” CAAS and IATA will also work on enhancing the IATA travel pass, including enabling QR code scanning by immigration officers, according to Monday’s statement. Singapore Airlines said in March that would become the world’s first airline to pilot the IATA Travel Pass, starting with passengers flying to London."

The president-elect’s morning stop Wednesday will have echoes of the last Catholic president. And some U.S. Capitol Police officers have contracted the coronavirus since the Jan. 6 riot. There is one day until President-elect Joe Biden’s swearing-in. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson congratulated Biden on his inauguration and said he looked forward to “working closely” with him to “defeat Covid and build back better from the pandemic.”In a statement released Tuesday, Johnson said the U.K. shared U.S. goals on “climate change, defense, security and in promoting and defending democracy” and the nations would work “hand in hand” to achieve them. Both Biden and Johnson have used the phrase “build back better” to describe their pandemic recovery efforts, a phrase long used by disaster recovery specialists.He said he looked forward to welcoming Biden to Cornwall, in the southwest of England, for the G7 summit and to Glasgow, Scotland, for the United Nations climate talks later this year. -- Emily Ashton Joe Biden’s decision to start his Inauguration Day with a prayer service at St. Matthew’s Cathedral is a clear nod from the nation’s second Catholic president to its first and recalls an iconic moment marking the end of John F. Kennedy’s Camelot saga. After his assassination on Nov. 22, 1963, Kennedy’s funeral was at St. Matthews, and a famous photo of three-year-old John F. Kennedy Jr. saluting his father’s casket was taken just outside the cathedral about a half-mile north of the White House. It’s an image and a place that seared into the memory of a generation of Americans, especially Catholics and Irish Catholics, an ethnic and religious background that Biden and Kennedy share. The setting connects Biden to the sense of hope and progress Kennedy aroused in his time as well as evoking a storied moment of loss and tragedy, likely intentional given the toll the nation has faced from coronavirus, economic decline and the storming of the Capitol. It is also inherently a cautionary note on the cost of political division and violence. -- Mike Dorning As Washington prepares for the highest-security inauguration in years, some Capitol Police officers won’t be able to help. As of Tuesday, at least 19 officers were quarantining at home after testing positive for Covid-19, while still others were being sent home as a result of contact tracing, according to an official familiar with staffing issues. The cases come two weeks after groups of rioters, few of whom were wearing masks, stormed the Capitol. It’s unknown if the cases are related. -- Billy House Steven Mnuchin, the outgoing Treasury secretary, on Tuesday sent his staff a farewell message that didn’t mention President Donald Trump. In the memo, Mnuchin wished “President-Elect Biden and Treasury Secretary-Designate Yellen great success,” referring to former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. Mnuchin also called the Jan. 6 riots on Capitol Hill a “completely unacceptable attack on our democratic institutions, and I believe those responsible should be held accountable.” A former hedge fund manager, Mnuchin was one of Trump’s earliest supporters and remained in his Cabinet for the entirety of his presidency. -- Saleha Mohsin The White House is having trouble finding guests for President Donald Trump’s send-off ceremony on Wednesday. Several prominent Republicans who were invited to the event at Joint Base Andrews early Wednesday don’t plan to attend, including the Senate and House GOP leaders, Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, according to people familiar with the matter. The White House has made some curious choices for its invitation list. Several former Trump aides who became outspoken critics of the president received invitations, including financier Anthony Scaramucci, who was the White House communications director for 11 days in 2017, but by 2019 was publicly advocating for Trump’s impeachment. Former Chief of Staff John Kelly and former National Security Adviser John Bolton and his deputy, Charlie Kupperman, also were invited. None of them will attend. Nor is Vice President Mike Pence. Aides said they anticipate a mixture of junior staff and some of Trump’s most loyal supporters. One former aide does plan to be there: Boris Epshteyn, who worked on Trump’s campaigns. -- Alex Wayne and Jennifer Jacobs The incoming Biden administration’s transportation team is considering creating an Aviation Recovery Commission to help guide its work assisting the airline industry rebound from the pandemic’s sharp downturn, a trade group says. Such a commission should be made up of officials from government, airlines, other travel industries and labor unions, along with advisers from science and health groups, Airlines for America saidin a letter to Pete Buttigieg, Biden’s nominee to become Transportation secretary. The trade group for large U.S. carriers said it supports creation of a commission, “which we understand is under consideration.” Airlines are losing billions of dollars and have required government assistance to avoid mass job losses because Covid-19 has sharply cut passengers. The 12-page letter lays out a broad wish list that carriers are seeking from the federal government, from a more efficient air traffic control system to standardized federal policies on the virus.The Biden transition didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. -- Alan Levin A woman who allegedly stole a laptop computer from Pelosi’s office during last week’s assault on the U.S. Capitol intended to sell it to Russian agents and has been arrested, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. A “former romantic partner” called the FBI tip line to identify Riley June Williams of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania as a person seen on a video of the event taking the laptop, according to a criminal complaint filed Sunday in federal court in Washington. The tipster alleged that Williams intended to send the device to a friend in Russia, who then intended to sell it to Russian intelligence agencies, according to the complaint. The complaint accuses Williams of knowingly entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds without lawful authority and of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. The alleged theft of the laptop remains under investigation. In videos of the assault, a woman identified as Williams appears to be directing intruders up a staircase, according to the complaint. Her mother told police that Williams had taken an interest in the politics of President Donald Trump and “far-right message boards” and had traveled to the Jan. 6 protest with her father. Afterward, she left home telling her mother she’d be gone for several weeks, according to the complaint. -- Alyza Sebenius Two members of the National Guard were removed from security at the inauguration over ties to fringe militia groups, though no threat to Biden was uncovered, the Associated Press reports. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been vetting the nearly 25,000 members of the National Guard assigned to the nation’s capital after the ransacking of the Capitol on Jan. 6. A number of law enforcement officers and several National Guard members participated in the riot, and officials said it is routine to vet people assigned to security details. It wasn’t immediately clear which state or territory the two Guard members came from. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who authorized 1,000 National Guard members to come to D.C., tweeted Monday that it was “the most offensive thing I’ve ever heard” that they were being vetted. The Republican chair of the congressional inauguration ceremony says it’s always a stressful event but that he feels good about the status of security preparations. Missouri Senator Roy Blunt said that he is staying “totally focused” on ensuring the ceremony goes off without a hitch, noting his response to a question ahead of Trump’s 2017 inauguration. “Somebody asked me what was your best moment of the inauguration, I said when everybody got back inside,” he told reporters. “I mean it’s clearly always a moment of where our governments is at its most vulnerable, but also an important moment where we project our strength as a democracy.” Blunt, who is chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, previously said he was disappointed that Trump will not be attending. -- Erik Wasson Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer -- who will soon switch jobs -- will go to church with Biden on the morning of inauguration along with Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. In a sign of unity, the top lawmakers will pray together at St. Matthew’s Cathedral in Washington before Biden’s swearing-in, according to two people familiar with the schedule. Biden will be only the second Catholic to serve as U.S. president. Trump and his wife Melania have refused to do the traditional get-togethers with the incoming president and will not attend inauguration. But other Republicans have stepped forward in their place. Vice President Mike Pence will be at inauguration and former President George W. Bush and his wife Laura will go to Arlington National Cemetery with the Bidens in the afternoon. -- Jennifer Jacobs A traditional inaugural prayer service -- which dates back to the start of the republic -- will be entirely virtual this year because of concerns about the coronavirus. Josh Groban, Patti LaBelle and the Clark Sisters are among the musical performers who will participate in the virtual prayer service at Washington National Cathedral on Wednesday morning ahead of Biden’s swearing in. Bishop William J. Barber II, who came to national prominence in part for leading “Moral Mondays” civil-rights protests in North Carolina, will deliver the homily, the Presidential Inaugural Committee announced. The interfaith service was first held at the inauguration of President George Washington. This year it will be livestreamed here, starting at 10 a.m. Wednesday morning. Biden is poised to become the second Roman Catholic and non-Protestant U.S. president. -- Kathleen Hunter Acting U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen issued a stern warning Tuesday that attempts to disrupt Joe Biden’s inauguration would be met with the full force of the Justice Department, calling the Jan. 6 deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol an “intolerable travesty.” “The Justice Department will have no tolerance for anyone who attempts to mar the day with violence or other criminal conduct,” Rosen said in a statement. “Anyone who does that will be caught, and they will be prosecuted.” The remarks from Rosen, who stepped into the top federal law enforcement role only last month after Attorney General William Barr stepped aside, come barely 24 hours before Biden is set to take the oath of office on the Capitol steps and amid an unprecedented security crackdown in Washington. Since Jan. 6, he said the DOJ has brought charges against more than 100 people in connection with the attack and that the FBI had received nearly 200,000 digital tips from the public. -- Kathleen Hunter Three new Democratic senators will all be sworn in on Wednesday, after Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris take office, giving Democrats control of the chamber, two people familiar with the plans said. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock were elected in Jan. 5 run-off elections in Georgia, defeating the two Republican incumbents. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla has been named to replace Harris in the Senate. The three new Democrats leave the Senate split 50-50 between Republicans and the Democratic caucus. Harris would cast any tie-breaking votes, meaning Democrats control the chamber agenda. Current Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will meet later Tuesday to lay out plans for the evenly split Senate as well as the process for an impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. -- Laura Litvan The day before his inauguration, five of Biden’s cabinet nominees have their confirmation hearings before Senate committees. Janet Yellen, the former Fed chair who was picked to lead the Treasury Department, will face questioning from the Finance Committee at 10 a.m. EST. At the same time, Biden’s pick to be director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, will appear before the Intelligence Committee, and Alejandro Mayorkas, tapped for the Department of Homeland Security, will testify to the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs panel. Afternoon hearings on Tuesday include retired General Lloyd Austin, Biden’s choice to lead the Defense Department, and Antony Blinken, his nominee for secretary of state. Despite hearings beginning before Wednesday’s inauguration, Biden is expected to take office with a cabinet made up largely, if not entirely, of acting secretaries. The confirmation hearings have to be followed by committee votes before the nominations go to the floor of the Senate. Working to Biden’s advantage: the Senate will shift to Democratic control after Biden becomes president and new senators from Georgia and California are sworn in. At that point, tie breakers in the Senate, which will be divided equally between Republicans and Democrats, will be cast by Harris. --Bill Faries Yellen Sees Republican Resistance to ‘Act Big’ Call for Stimulus Oath Keeper Faces First Conspiracy Charge Over Capitol Riot Why Presidential Pardons Are Normal, Trump’s Less So: QuickTake Trump Leaves Town an Outcast, Trailed by Pandemic, Job Losses"

Disney World Resort made masks optional in common outdoor areas, although they’re still required indoors, on all attractions and transportation. The theme park in Orlando, Florida, will continue to make adjustments as guidance evolves, it said late on Friday. Florida has no statewide mask mandate, though private businesses may require them. Walmart, the U.S.’s largest private employer, said on Friday that fully vaccinated staff and customers did not need to wear masks. At least two of the largest casinos in Las Vegas also dropped masking rules. Publix Super Markets Inc., one of the nation’s largest regional grocery chains, said it would no longer require masks for fully vaccinated workers or staff, unless local rules required them. Trader Joe’s Co. and Costco Wholesale Corp. are taking a similar approach. Overall infections in the U.S. continued their decline to the lowest levels since early autumn, even as the country recorded slightly more than 41,000 new cases on Friday, the most in a week, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg. As vaccines roll out at a steady if slower pace, average weekly cases were down or even in all U.S. states and territories except Wyoming, according to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fatalities also continued to decline, with another 746 deaths recorded, albeit at a slower rate than cases. Daily fatalities haven’t been above 1,000 in more than a month. Indian banks have lost more than a thousand employees and many more are infected, S. Nagarajan, the general secretary of the All India Bank Officers’ Association, said on Saturday. With more than 24 million people sickened in India and over 266,200 dead, most Indian states are in a lockdown with strict stay-at-home orders. But the banking sector is slotted as an essential service and is partially exempt from the lockdown orders. Lenders are allowed in some cases to call as much as 50% of their workforce into branches to avoid any disruption in banking services. Soldiers will be sent to the English town of Bolton to hand out tests on the street, according to The Times. The town’s infection rate has more than doubled in a week, with cases reaching 193 per 100,000 in the seven days to May 9, government data show. Singapore reported 19 new local virus cases on Saturday and 12 imported infections. Checking in to a hotel room in Singapore, starting Sunday, could also mean agreeing to random checks from staff to ensure only two guests are in the room, a step one hotel in the Marina Bay area is asking customers to agree to. People who breach the safety measures may be fined as much as S$10,000 ($7,506) or jailed for as long as six months, or both, according to the document given to staycationers at check-in. Singapore is returning to lockdown-like conditions after seeing a rising number of untraceable virus infections. Bloomberg’s Derek Wallbank reports. Source: Bloomberg Cases in Moscow remained above 3,000 for a second day on Saturday, after jumping to the highest level since January on Friday. While President Vladimir Putin oversaw his annual Victory Day parade on Red Square last weekend, a popular running race through the Russian capital scheduled for this Sunday was canceled because of the epidemiological situation. Deputy Mayor Anastasia Rakova said the virus situation remains tense and “the numbers don’t make us happy,” state news service Tass reported on Friday. Infections in Germany dropped to 87.3 per 100,000 people over the past seven days, the lowest level since mid-March, according to the RKI public-health institute. The country’s lockdown law allows curbs to be loosened if the incidence rate falls below 100 for five consecutive working days. More than 30 million citizens, or 36.5% of the population, have received at least a first shot of Covid-19 vaccine, and more than 9 million are fully inoculated, Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a Twitter post. Infections in the Czech Republic slipped further. The country recorded 1,050 new daily Covid cases in the past 24 hours on Saturday, fewer than the 1,218 in the previous 24 hours and less than half the daily level seen at the start of May. India reported 326,098 new infections Saturday, keeping with a downward trend the past week after hitting an all-time high of more than 414,000 cases earlier this month, stirring hope the virus curve may have peaked in the Asian nation. India’s total infection tally has now crossed 24 million while Covid-related deaths have exceeded 266,200, according to latest data from India’s health ministry. More than 180 million Covid vaccines have been administered in in the country so far, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. Businesses from Walt Disney Co.’s theme park in Florida to Walmart Inc. have loosened their mask requirements after the CDC’s Thursday announcement. Governor Andrew Cuomo said that more than half of New Yorkers 18 years and older are now fully vaccinated. Covid has killed more than 1,000 bank employees in India, which has declared banking services essential even as the disease ravages the country, a key industry body said.

Florida’s other major theme parks joined Walt Disney World in loosening masking policies.  Universal Studios Orlando set a policy in line with that of Disney World, saying masks are optional outdoors but are required inside, including in shops, restaurants and attractions. Unlike updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the park made no distinction between vaccinated and unvaccinated visitors.  SeaWorld Orlando and its sister park Busch Gardens Tampa said that people who were fully vaccinated didn’t have to wear masks at all, though in line with CDC guidance. “We will not require proof of vaccine, but ask our guests to respectfully comply with our revised policy,” statements from the parks read. Park workers must continue to wear masks. U.S. schools should maintain mask requirements at least through the end of the academic year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in its latest guidance, even after saying fully vaccinated adults can safely shed face coverings in most settings. “Universal and correct use of masks should be required” at K-12 schools providing in-person instruction, the CDC said in a statement Saturday. “Physical distancing should be maximized to the greatest extent possible.” That includes creating distance between children on school buses when possible and ensuring that “teachers and staff use proper handwashing and respiratory etiquette,” according to the agency. California’s seven-day average positive test rate was little changed at 1.1%, the health department’s website said. The state reported 1,864 new Covid-19 cases yesterday, a rate of 3.4 new cases per 100,000. There were 27 deaths, up from zero the previous day. California has administered more than 34.1 million vaccines in total. Governor Andrew Cuomo said that more than half of New Yorkers 18 years and older are now fully vaccinated, and 61% have at least one dose. Almost 17.5 million shots have been administered. New York’s outbreak eased further. The state reported 2,041 new cases, and a seven-day average of 1.18% for positive test results, among the lowest in the U.S. Hospitalizations continued to fall. Unlike many other state leaders, Cuomo has not announced changes to rules on mask wearing after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention loosened its guidelines on Thursday. Democratic lawmakers urged the Biden administration to immediately make available tens of millions of surplus vaccine doses to Colombia and to Latin America more broadly. The request came in a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken focused on a call to end U.S. weapons sales to the Colombian police. “Colombia is undergoing its third and most deadly surge of Covid-19. We can make a genuine difference in restoring health, security, confidence, and hope among the Colombian people,” the lawmakers wrote. Bloomberg News reported Saturday that the “stockpile” of shots in the US is less apparent than many believe, since most unused doses are scattered across tens of thousands of locations. Singapore won’t allow entry to short-term travelers holding an Air Travel Pass with travel history to Taiwan within the past 21 days amid rising infections. Others with travel history to Taiwan in the past 21 days who are not Singapore citizens or permanent residents will be required to take a test within 72 hours before departure, and would need to present a negative test result as a condition of approval for entry, the Singapore Ministry of Health said in a statement Saturday. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders entering the country who have been to Taiwan, will be subject to a 14-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilities, followed by an additional 7-day quarantine at their homes. President Emmanuel Macron tweeted on Saturday that 20 million people have now received a first vaccine dose in France. Earlier today, Prime Minister Jean Castex said the goal was to administer 30 million first doses by mid-June. “The situation is improving,” Castex said. As of Friday night, almost 30% of France’s total population had received a first dose and 38% of those 18 years and older, the government said.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-04/another-regional-u-s-airline-falls-to-the-covid-19-recession,2020-08-04T08:00:09.783Z,Another Regional Airline Falls to the Covid-19 Recession,['Justin Bachman'],Business,"ExpressJet’s CEO says the hub-and-spoke carrier model still has a future, even if his airline doesn’t. Passengers board a United Express passenger aircraft, operated by ExpressJet Airlines, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 2015. The Big Three U.S. airlines are unlikely to dismantle the regional carrier model any time soon, so long as they rely on massive hubs to generate profits. This outlook is from the CEO of ExpressJet Airlines, one of the largest regional carriers in America, and one which plans to shut down this year. ExpressJet is the fourth U.S. regional airline to collapse since the Covid-19 pandemic decimated air travel. Through a subsidiary, United Airlines Holdings Inc. owns 49.9% of the airline, which it acquired from SkyWest Inc. in late 2018 to bolster its regional flying. United has decided to end its flights with ExpressJet as part of the carrier’s broader, pandemic-induced retrenchment. At one time, the regional airline—formerly Continental Express—was among the world’s top 10 by fleet size, with more than 400 aircraft. It also operated as an independent and charter carrier at various points in its history. But those days are over. “It’s a proud old company that’s had more life than a cat,” Chief Executive Officer Subodh Karnik said Monday, pledging an orderly transition for the airline’s 131 Embraer SA 145 jets and the “mountain of parts” it has subleased from United. It’s unclear how many of ExpressJet’s 50-seat E145s may be transferred to CommutAir, another regional airline operator in which United holds a stake, or how many United will choose to park. Those decisions could also affect how many pilots and flight attendants keep working: Atlanta-based ExpressJet has 2,800 active employees. United warned last month that it would consolidate its 50-seat Embraer business with just one airline, causing ExpressJet and its labor groups to quickly devise proposals for retaining the business. On Thursday, a United spokesman said CommutAir “will operate a fleet that matches the current demand environment.” Before the pandemic struck, more than half of United’s daily departures were flown by regional carriers. “An airline that has been flying for 33 years comes with a mature pilot group and contract,” Joe Mauro, chairman of the ExpressJet chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association, said in a memo to members. “While this is something we are proud of, it must have been seen as a negative to the decisionmakers at UAL.” CommutAir pilots are also members of ALPA. Karnik, who said each ExpressJet E145 is associated with staffing of as many as 11 pilots and six flight attendants, argued that even with sudden reversals tied to the pandemic, regional carriers are likely to survive because of the operating advantages they give large airlines on fleets and costs. “If there are airlines that have to have hubs, there is no way that the small-airline model is going to die,” said Karnik, a former senior executive at Continental and Delta Air Lines Inc. “The adage in the airline industry that I buy into is that presence drives preference drives profits,” meaning that travelers in smaller cities value airline choice and service frequency. As recently as late February, United and ExpressJet had announced plans to consolidate all of United’s 50-seat Embraer flying at the regional carrier and modernize the jets’ cabins with streaming inflight entertainment. News of ExpressJet’s demise prompted the Regional Airline Association to renew its call for greater federal financial assistance from Washington to avoid a loss of air access in smaller markets. “Congress did not intend to leave smaller carriers behind. However, Treasury has declined to exercise the flexibility granted under the CARES Act to work with smaller carriers,” the RAA said Friday, referring to the $3 trillion Congressional bailout package. Only one regional airline, SkyWest, has been able to reach terms for a potential loan, RAA President Faye Malarkey Black said. The Utah-based carrier said last week it could borrow $497 million from the government if needed. Treasury officials are asking carriers seeking less than $300 million to prove that they’ve been declined by the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending program for small and medium-sized businesses before they can request airline loans, Black said. A Treasury spokeswoman on Monday confirmed that the agency is requiring some smaller companies to apply first with banks in the Fed program. “This eleventh hour reversal of eligibility came after carriers spent over three months of negotiation with Treasury, and spent money on Treasury-requested appraisals,” Black said in an email. “If Treasury continues to deny smaller carriers this vital, Congressionally-passed assistance, the consequences for air service in rural America could be dire.”"

The aviation industry has suffered more than most as the pandemic destroys ticket sales and strips companies of cash.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/mexico-boosts-air-safety-budget-40-after-cuts-hurt-u-s-rating,2021-05-27T19:54:01.283Z,FAA Rebuke Spurs Mexico to Add Back Air Safety Inspectors,"['Max De Haldevang', 'Alan Levin']",Business,"Mexico’s civil aviation authority is getting a budget lift of about 40% and hiring 180 new inspectors, an effort it hopes will reverse a U.S. air-safety downgrade that the agency’s director acknowledged was partly prompted by spending cuts. The roughly 150 million-peso ($7.5 million) increase will also go to raise wages and improve flight crew training in English, according to Carlos Antonio Rodriguez Munguia, the head of Mexico’s Federal Civil Aviation Agency (AFAC). Both are areas the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration found to be inadequate, along with lack of inspectors, Rodriquez told Bloomberg News in an interview. Carlos Antonio Rodriguez Munguia, the head of Mexico’s Federal Civil Aviation Agency, speaks to Bloomberg about U.S. air safety downgrade, and what his country is doing to reverse it. (Source: Bloomberg) The downgrade Tuesday blindsided Mexico, which believed it had completed 97% of the FAA’s requirements, including making changes to aeronautical law, Rodriguez said. The FAA has yet to meet with its Mexican counterparts since the decision, he said, and the Mexican officials are trying to arrange a meeting. Reducing the nation’s airline industry to the FAA’s lowest safety ranking “surprised us a lot because we assumed we had completed nearly all the actions we had to take,” Rodriguez said. Since the downgrade, “we’ve had no clarification of what we missed or where we failed.” The FAA’s decision puts a major cloud over a country that has consistently been the top foreign destination for U.S. travelers. The downgrade doesn’t affect existing flights to the U.S. on Mexican airlines, but stops them from adding services. It also ends Delta Air Lines Inc.’s ability to sell tickets on Aeromexico flights and a similar cooperation agreement between Volaris and Frontier Airlines Holdings Inc. Read More: Mexico’s Air-Safety Rating Lowered by U.S., Limiting Flights U.S. officials believe they have given Mexican authorities full details about the issues that need resolving, said a person familiar with that country’s actions who wasn’t permitted to speak publicly. The U.S. has also offered Mexico expertise and other assistance, the person said. Rodriguez said that during the review, the FAA listed past failings over safety, including some crews having dangerously low levels of English and that Mexico hadn’t properly implemented a system to report defects or mechanical failures to plane manufacturers. “They have had incidents in which safety has been put at risk due to a lack of adequate understanding of the language,” Rodriguez said, referring to comments the FAA made during its audit. Rodriguez said he hopes Mexico can resolve the issue within a month by detailing its efforts to address the FAA’s complaints. It could take two to three months, however, if the Mexican authorities need to wait until new training is completed. The AFAC’s budget has been dramatically cut over the past decade and has been slashed heavily since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office in 2018. Those cuts have made it more difficult to retain staff and keep up training standards, said Rodriguez, who hopes to retain the new budget increase into 2022. “There are a lot people who leave and get a better paid job in the industry due to the experience gained at AFAC,” said Rodriguez. “With a reduced budget it’s also difficult to have adequate training with the frequency that’s needed.” Similar issues with a lack of staffing helped lead to the FAA’s downgrade of Mexico’s air-safety standing in 2010, said another person familiar with the earlier action. He asked not to be named discussing sensitive diplomatic matters. The FAA returned Mexico to a passing rating within months in 2010, partly because it was able to quickly hire more inspectors, the person said. Mexico has joined another eight nations listed as what FAA calls “Category 2” for not meeting international safety standards, including Bangladesh, Pakistan, Venezuela and Thailand. The FAA audits look at whether nations have adequate aviation regulations and the ability to enforce them. Other FAA complaints included that Mexico had failed to quickly certify new types of technology, such as advances allowing two-engine planes to fly transatlantic trips, Rodriguez said. It also pointed to failures to update certification processes for airlines."

The government will lift a quarantine requirement on vaccinated residents returning from medium-risk destinations starting July 19, including most of Europe and the U.S. The long-awaited move promises to spur airline travel, as British tourists gain confidence they can plan trips without holing up at home for 10 days when they get back. While welcome for travelers, the change thrusts border systems back into the spotlight that were stressed by a dramatic increase in entries when Britain first lifted a ban on most overseas travel. Backups reached several hours as border guards took time to inspect Covid-19 test documents, while faster e-gates were sidelined and social distancing requirements limited the number of desks that could open at one time. “Border Force have assured us that they can manage an increase in demand and it’s up to them to deliver,” said Weston Macklem, a spokesman for London Heathrow airport. “It’s not going to look great for them if over the summer people get these new freedoms but have to wait in massive queues.” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said Friday that the government is increasing Border Force staff to cope with the extra queues. It has also sought to automate processing where it can, while handing some duties like Covid-19 test-result checks to airlines which have rolled out apps to make the job easier. Most of the verification will be done at check-in, Shapps said. The arrangements will also apply to ferry and rail firms, he said, referring to Channel Tunnel rail operator Eurostar International Ltd. “The real backlog would potentially be in the place you leave from, rather than when you get back to the U.K.,” he told the BBC. “Travel is going to be more disrupted than it was back in 2019 because we’ve got an important job to do to make sure we keep coronavirus under check. But I know everyone’s working very hard to minimize those queues.” Some staff have been brought back from retirement and reallocated from other tasks, said Lucy Moreton, a spokeswoman for the Immigration Services Union, which represents border agents. Border Force is also set to remove the social-distancing requirements for staff from July 19, opening more kiosks, she said. Automated gates are open at London Gatwick and some are being used at London Heathrow, with more coming online soon, according to the airports. This will ease passage for the bulk of travelers affected by the new rules, as Britons can generally use e-gates after filling out digital passenger locator forms that themselves track scheduled tests and will store vaccination status. Border staff aren’t carrying out any added test-result checks on people who go through the e-gates, according to Moreton. Border Force officials didn’t respond to requests for comment. “Anyone not complying with health measures could face a fine, and carriers will be required to ensure proper checks are carried out,” the Department for Transport said in a statement on its website. Thursday’s announcement is likely to spur hordes of vaccinated Britons to consider an overseas holiday this summer as the government removed advice against traveling to amber-listed countries like Spain, Portugal and Italy. In the hours after Thursday’s announcement, discount carrier EasyJet Plc said bookings to amber-list countries quintupled, and put an extra 145,000 seats on sale. British Airways reported a doubling of flight searches from a week ago. Wizz Air Holdings Plc said Friday it will restart flights to 25 destinations on the U.K. amber list, taking the number of green and amber options for Britons to 44. Wizz shares rose as much as 1.8%, while EasyJet gained 3.5%, BA owner IAG SA 3.1% and Ryanair Holdings Plc 2.8%. It’s still not clear whether the changes at the border will be enough to keep up with rising passenger volumes, according to union spokeswoman Moreton. Arrivals from many countries aren’t able to use the e-gates, and will have to be processed manually. “Any increase in passengers will result in an exponential increase in queues,” she said. Another question is whether travelers will properly fill out the forms. One reason the Border Force was asked to check all documentation was because of non-compliance, she said. The government said it would consider extending the relaxation of self-isolation requirements -- which now apply only to residents -- to visitors from Europe or the U.S. later this summer. “We’re actively working on it and I should be able to return shortly on that,” Shapps said. “It’s easier from some places than others.” The European Union has developed a system very similar to Britain’s own National Heath Service app, whereas the U.S. “has 50 different systems for each state and much of it is paper based,” he said. Airline groups want more, urging the government to allow all fully vaccinated people to enter, and to do away with costly testing requirements. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. are trialling app-based vaccination-check technology at Heathrow in hopes it will prove to authorities that it can work. “Airlines have been really keen to push a streamlined system, and that will clearly benefit passengers,” said Rory Boland, the travel editor for consumer group Which? “Governments and border forces have had a good amount of time to prepare for this so they really should already have solutions ready.”"

The Palace of Fine Arts (Palacio de Bellas Artes) is a prominent cultural center in Mexico City hosting many exhibitions and theatrical performances. Cyntia Barrera Diaz is a Bloomberg Breaking News Editor, based in Mexico City. On most weekends in the trendy Condesa, Roma, and Polanco neighborhoods of Mexico City, restaurants’ outdoor seats are packed with long-lingering patrons and their pets, unfazed by the traffic passing just inches away. Joggers can be seen training in the early morning, winding through the expansive Chapultepec park and down tree-lined Reforma Avenue. On Sundays, hundreds of residents take over some of the capital’s main streets, thanks to a popular government-organized bike ride for all ages. Life seems unusually normal in many parts of Mexico’s capital, even though the country ranks fourth worldwide in Covid-19 deaths and the city is currently seeing an acceleration of weekly cases and hospitalizations.  Still, there are lingering markers of Covid’s impact: Masaryk Avenue, often referred to as Mexico’s Rodeo Drive, has more “For Rent” signs peppering its facades than ever before. And some restrictions remain: Restaurants, hotels and malls are generally limited to 60% capacity while indoors, and movie theaters and outdoor stadiums are capped at 50%. Getting to this point has been a game of tug-of-war. Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum lifted most Covid-19 restrictions in early June  as cases declined, only to reverse course  two weeks later as they spiked.  Locals are now regaining confidence on the heels of a  revved-up vaccination campaign that aims to curb the virus spread during the busier summer months. While a reported 64% of the adult population have received at least one dose to date, president Lopez Obrador has committed to have all eligible people vaccinated with at least one shot by October. In Mexico City, cases are rising among the 20-to-39 age group and authorities are still bracing for a third wave to peak in August, with only 38% of adults expected to be vaccinated by then. The  race to vaccinate is especially important in the face of Mexico’s tourism restrictions—or total lack thereof. With no requirement to quarantine or test before arrival, some of the capital’s hotels and vacation rentals have been busy taking in international visitors who seek the U.S. as their final destination but who are banned from going there until they spend two weeks in an approved country, such as Mexico. Sylvain Chauvet, general manager of the Sofitel Reforma hotel, says things started picking up gradually in January 2021, and vaccinated Americans have been arriving in larger numbers since March. The hotel’s rooftop restaurant, Cityzen, which serves ambitious cocktails with a breathtaking skyline view, is packed on weekends—although it’s still separating tables with partitions. The scene there perfectly encapsulates Mexico City’s current reality: culinary greatness served with plenty of lingering precautions. Here’s what to expect if you’re thinking about an adventure in this incomparable megalopolis. Around 20% of all restaurants in Mexico have pulled the plug since the beginning of the pandemic as lockdowns, wary customers, and a lack of economic support from the government choked businesses. Among the notable closures: Sir Winston Churchill’s, a 50-year-old restaurant in a Tudor-style mansion known for its superb Wellington steak and political powerhouse crowd. Conversely, hundreds of street taco stands remained open amid lax enforcement from local authorities seeking to keep the informal economy afloat.  Outdoor dining has been a blessing in disguise for many spots, though it started awkwardly in January amid a harsh second wave that saturated hospitals beds. Now it’s set to become a permanent feature. But the city’s fine-dining darlings, such as Pujol and Quintonil, rely on indoor service for a fuller, more controlled experience; now that this is an option, reservations are being taken for spaced-apart indoor tables at least four to six weeks out, and getting in is no easy feat.  There are notable newcomers, too. The tiny, female-owned bar  Las Brujas, adjacent to beautiful Rio de Janeiro Plaza, is fast developing an outsized reputation for such risk-taking drinks as “Fairy Poison,” made with mezcal, rice milk, and lavender syrup. (It’s also a great spot to wind up after exploring the area’s many architectural jewels.) Maximo Bistrot, an old favorite, might as well be new again: It relocated in 2020 to a spacious, industrial-looking site in the dynamic Roma Norte neighborhood, with plenty of additions to a constantly changing menu that uses anything from ants to delicate rain mushrooms. For those still concerned about dining out, established local chef Somsri Raksamran has made plenty of Mexican fans with  Pin-tó, a dark kitchen dishing out meal kits comprising Thai small plates. And  Piedra Braza, a reservations-only Argentinean grill about an hour southwest of the city limits, serves fixed-menu options in the middle of the woods.  Mexico City is emerging from the worst months of the pandemic, which may leave some visitors feeling more cautious than others.  If you’re still Covid-weary: Rent a colorful, flat-bottom gondola, called a trajinera, to explore the canal gardens in Xochimilco; either pack a picnic or visit one of the many outdoor family-run restaurants nearby once you’ve worked up an appetite. If you plan ahead, the local chef collective Arca Tierra organizes trajinera outings at the break of dawn, culminating with breakfasts sourced from native ingredients. Hot air balloon trips above the magnificent Aztec archaeological site of Teotihuacan are another unforgettable, socially distant option, as is the the sprawling Chapultepec Castle, which currently allows only 1,800 daily visitors to visit its history-packed rooms and gardens.  If you need a gentle reentry: Museums are open but running at 50% capacity. A giant installation by Mexican artist Tania Candiani of a black car standing on its nose is parked in front of the museum; inside, the artist’s daring mixed-media works tell the city’s history over the last eight centuries. Show up when the museum opens at 10 a.m. and walk in for free. Tickets are required to visit the famous  Frida Kahlo’s Blue House museum in the heart of the quaint Coyoacan neighborhood, but parties are restricted to two persons. If you can’t get in, the nearby  Anahuacalli museum gathers Diego Rivera’s enormous collection of pre-Hispanic artifacts in a pyramid-like building made of volcanic rock. If you want to pretend the pandemic never happened: Night clubs are among a handful of businesses that are not yet allowed to operate, though underground events are advertised frequently via social media. A little less daring are live drive-in concerts at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, a venue that also stages car races; popular Mexican rock band Los Caifanes started the trend in mid-May and Molotov, another famous rock group, will play a pair of shows in August, possibly with scores of open-air pods for added seating. The first mass sporting event scheduled for the city will be Formula 1 in October, and authorities seem keen on selling loads of tickets and avoiding cancelation.   Subways and buses, crowded in Mexico City, are perceived by many as unsafe during the pandemic. Ride-hailing apps such as Uber, DiDi, or Beat (which provides Tesla rides in select tourist neighborhoods) are an easy, affordable alternative; most drivers require masks and have installed passenger partitions. That said, the city’s famous traffic is almost back to normal.  Another option is EcoBici, which offers bike-sharing stations across several residential areas, often near subway or bus stations. With 45-minute rental intervals and flimsy frames, they’re great for short trips but not for crisscrossing the vast city. Online registration requires your passport, so avoid applying on the go.  Bike riders beware: While city officials have made cycling safer by expanding dedicated lanes, some roads have car traffic moving in one direction and public buses moving the other way. Take advantage of Sunday street closures along large portions of Reforma Avenue as a no-stress way to see the city on two wheels. With several Covid variants circulating in Mexico City amid a large unvaccinated population, mask wearing is still seen as critically important—even if enforcement is tricky at times for proprietors. Stores and restaurants are welcoming customers back after months of hardship, and must comply with government-issued sanitary rules: cleaning your shoes on mats at the entrance, applying hand sanitizer, and checking your body temperature. Staff may often turn a blind eye to those taking face masks off or using them incorrectly once they are inside. Don’t copy others if they flash their unmasked pearly whites. Many hotel workers, restaurant staff, and drivers live in the outskirts of the city and spend multiple hours commuting daily on public transit—resulting in great personal risk. If tips of 10% to 15% were previously customary in Mexico City, now is a great time to be more generous, especially with favorable exchange rates for Americans and Europeans against the peso. Don’t expect the city to have become any quieter. Even the pandemic was unable to silence the late-night battles among carts selling hot tamales and baked sweet potatoes or the early morning bells announcing garbage trucks. Packing a pair of ear plugs could be wise."
